Low wages, inflexible work arrangements, lack of growth opportunities, jobs that don\'t reflect workers\' values, too many health risks, etc. The reasons why millions of employees have left their jobs are as varied as they are valid.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThis mass movement, which now spans several countries, first made its mark in the United States in 2021, where 24 million workers quit between April and September. This trend is called \\"The Great Resignation\\". The labor market is more favorable to employees than employers and makes it less daunting than it used to be to leave a job and find a new one. According to a [Statistics Canada study on labour shortage trends, the unemployment-to-job vacancy ratio in Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/subjects-start/labour_/labour-shortage-trends-canada) \\"is historically low\\" and has fallen from 3.2 to 1.4 between the first quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022.\\n\\nA context that primarily benefits employees also presents many challenges for employers who must simultaneously develop strategies to retain staff and be attractive in the labour market.\\n\\nAs an employer, what is the best way to deal with a period of high resignation? \\n\\n## Offer flexible work arrangements\\nThe pandemic was marked by the widespread adoption of remote work, which has become commonplace. In the aftermath of the stringent health measures, preferences for work arrangements differ. Some employees are leaving their jobs because working from home is forced upon them and others because they are required to be in the workplace. \\n\\nToday, it is critical for employers to be adaptable and offer flexible work arrangements. Whether it\'s hybrid or remote work, flexible hours or compressed work weeks, employers are more likely to retain and motivate their workers and attract new ones if they are flexible. \\n\\nIn addition, in a context where the spread of COVID-19 is still a concern, offering these alternatives to employees allows those at risk of complications to have access to safer working conditions.\\n\\n## Offer competitive salaries and benefits\\nIn order to be competitive, it is important that the salaries and benefits offered by a company set it apart and meet the expectations of employees. These elements should be viewed as an investment in attracting and retaining skilled workers who will play a key role in the growth of an organization. According to a [study conducted by BDC on how to adapt to a labour shortage](https://www.bdc.ca/en/about/analysis-research/labour-shortage), 41% of employees who were considering leaving their jobs at the time of the study wanted higher salaries, and 21% wanted more benefits. \\n\\n## Invest in the professional development of your employees\\nIn 2022, finding employees with the right skills is particularly difficult. To alleviate this problem, companies can turn to their existing staff by offering them internal training to improve their skills. This strategy is effective in maximizing employees\' potential and encouraging them to develop skills that will allow them to grow within the organization.\\n\\nEmployees are not always aware of the training opportunities available to them within a company, so communicating these opportunities to them is essential.\\n\\nCompanies also need to create regular career growth opportunities that match the evolving skills of their staff. Investing in employee growth is a key strategy to foster talent retention. \\n\\n## Make sure employees feel appreciated and valued\\nEmployee satisfaction within an organization is directly linked to higher retention rates, as workers are less likely to be absent or quit. As an employer or manager, it is important to celebrate the individual and collective accomplishments of their staff. Employers should also ensure that they reward behaviors that are encouraged as part of the company culture. \\n\\n## In a nutshell\\nBeing attractive in the job market by offering competitive salaries and benefits can definitely help an employer attract potential employees. However, a company\'s current workforce must be the focus of significant effort in order to retain talent in the context of \u201c The Great Resignation\\". Employees want to be heard, valued and know that they can grow and evolve within their organization. Employers need to put in place smart, sophisticated strategies to ensure employee satisfaction and retention. \\n\\n## En bref\\n\xcatre attractif sur le march\xe9 du travail en offrant des salaires et des avantages sociaux comp\xe9titifs peuvent d\xe9finitivement permettre \xe0 un employeur d\u2019attirer des employ\xe9s potentiels. Cependant, le personnel actuel d\u2019une entreprise doit \xeatre l\u2019objet d\u2019efforts importants afin de favoriser la r\xe9tention de talents dans le contexte de \xab\u2009Grande D\xe9mission\u2009\xbb. \\n\\nLes employ\xe9s souhaitent avant tout \xeatre \xe9cout\xe9s, valoris\xe9s et veulent savoir qu\u2019ils peuvent \xe9voluer au sein de leur organisation.

The use of new technologies and the switch to more flexible working arrangements are now commonplace. Many workers are turning to on-demand jobs for the flexibility they can benefit from.\\n\\nIf you rely on on-demand workers, consider using technology tools that have the potential to make it easier to plan your operations and communicate with your temporary staff.\\n\\n[**Learn more about Workstaff and the features you can use to make your operations easier.**](https://workstaff.app/)"},{"id":"product-updates-august-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/product-updates-august-2022","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-11-product-updates/index.md","title":"Product Updates - August 2022","description":"Swap staff, manage clients, invoicing improvements on the mobile app, and some other goodies are on the menu for this update.","date":"2022-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 11, 2022","tags":[{"label":"product updates","permalink":"/blog/tags/product-updates"}],"readingTime":2.575,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"David Marquis","title":"Lead Produit","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/393893?v=4","key":"dmarquis"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"product-updates-august-2022","title":"Product Updates - August 2022","authors":["dmarquis"],"tags":["product updates"],"image":"./202208-product-updates.jpg"},"prevItem":{"title":"The Gigification of Work","permalink":"/blog/the-gigification-of-work"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Rebirth of The Event Industry","permalink":"/blog/the-rebirth-of-the-event-industry"}},"content":"Swap staff, manage clients, invoicing improvements on the mobile app, and some other goodies are on the menu for this update.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Swap / Replace Staff\\n\\nPreviously, replacing a staff booked on a schedule was a rather complex endeavour that required many steps:\\n\\n1.

Indeed, it is possible to virtually attend concerts, conferences, promotional events, conventions, and much more. \\n\\nThe pandemic has accelerated the adoption of technology as a tool for organizing and communicating at events, but also as an integral and essential part of those events. \\n\\nMany companies have embraced this long-term approach and plan to continue offering virtual events even after the health constraints of the pandemic have been alleviated.\\n\\n## The Long Awaited Return of Physical Events\\nHowever, according to recent studies, a large majority of people still prefer physical events to virtual ones for the exchanges, the conviviality and the human experience they offer. \\n\\nThis interest is all the more visible with the return in force of participants to face-to-face gatherings in recent months. Today, with the removal of multiple health constraints, the events sector is experiencing a positive trend. \\n\\nThe disruption has resulted in a significant amount of rescheduling of events that can finally take place, in addition to those that are being organized after the two years of restrictions. \\n\\nCatering services, staffing agencies, event organizers and other players in this sector must now respond to an extremely high demand and implement adequate logistical, organizational and technological means to cope with such a craze.\\n\\n## The Undeniable Advantages of Technology \\nIn a context where it is possible to take advantage of more freedom than during the last two years, the pandemic persists despite everything and the importance of hybrid events is indisputable if one wants to get closer to his audience. \\n\\nThe impact of the pandemic on the event industry has led to a growing use of technological tools that allow the digitization of events, but also their organization and communication. \\n\\nWorkstaff is a platform widely used in the event industry for its functionalities that facilitate, among other things, the management of schedules, the planning of personnel and the communication with the teams. \\n\\nYou can stay informed of your workers\' availability, book them and publish offers they can apply for at their fingertips on the mobile app, thanks to which they are always reachable through instant messaging. \\n\\nThese tools have proven to be particularly beneficial in recent months as the tidal wave of the event industry has overwhelmed. \\n\\nLearn more about Workstaff and its features by visiting our [**Help Center**](https://help.workstaff.app/docs/managers/)."}]}')}}]);
