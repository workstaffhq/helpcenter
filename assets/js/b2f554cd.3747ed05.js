Low wages, inflexible work arrangements, lack of growth opportunities, jobs that don\'t reflect workers\' values, too many health risks, etc. The reasons why millions of employees have left their jobs are as varied as they are valid.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThis mass movement, which now spans several countries, first made its mark in the United States in 2021, where 24 million workers quit between April and September. This trend is called \\"The Great Resignation\\". The labor market is more favorable to employees than employers and makes it less daunting than it used to be to leave a job and find a new one. According to a [Statistics Canada study](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/subjects-start/labour_/labour-shortage-trends-canada) on labour shortage trends, the unemployment-to-job vacancy ratio in Canada \\"is historically low\\" and has fallen from 3.2 to 1.4 between the first quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022.\\n\\nA context that primarily benefits employees also presents many challenges for employers who must simultaneously develop strategies to retain staff and be attractive in the labour market.\\n\\nAs an employer, what is the best way to deal with a period of high resignation?\\n\\n## Offer flexible work arrangements\\nThe pandemic was marked by the widespread adoption of remote work, which has become commonplace. In the aftermath of the stringent health measures, preferences for work arrangements differ. Some employees are leaving their jobs because working from home is forced upon them and others because they are required to be in the workplace.\\n\\nToday, it is critical for employers to be adaptable and offer flexible work arrangements. Whether it\'s hybrid or remote work, flexible hours or compressed work weeks, employers are more likely to retain and motivate their workers and attract new ones if they are flexible.\\n\\nIn addition, in a context where the spread of COVID-19 is still a concern, offering these alternatives to employees allows those at risk of complications to have access to safer working conditions.\\n\\n## Offer competitive salaries and benefits\\nIn order to be competitive, it is important that the salaries and benefits offered by a company set it apart and meet the expectations of employees. These elements should be viewed as an investment in attracting and retaining skilled workers who will play a key role in the growth of an organization. According to a [**study conducted by BDC**](https://www.bdc.ca/en/about/analysis-research/labour-shortage) on how to adapt to a labour shortage, 41% of employees who were considering leaving their jobs at the time of the study wanted higher salaries, and 21% wanted more benefits.\\n\\n## Invest in the professional development of your employees\\nIn 2022, finding employees with the right skills is particularly difficult. To alleviate this problem, companies can turn to their existing staff by offering them internal training to improve their skills. This strategy is effective in maximizing employees\' potential and encouraging them to develop skills that will allow them to grow within the organization.\\n\\nEmployees are not always aware of the training opportunities available to them within a company, so communicating these opportunities to them is essential. Companies also need to create regular career growth opportunities that match the evolving skills of their staff. Investing in employee growth is a key strategy to foster talent retention.\\n\\n## Make sure employees feel appreciated and valued\\nEmployee satisfaction within an organization is directly linked to higher retention rates, as workers are less likely to be absent or quit. As an employer or manager, it is important to celebrate the individual and collective accomplishments of their staff. Employers should also ensure that they reward behaviours that are encouraged as part of the company culture.\\n\\n## In a nutshell\\nBeing attractive in the job market by offering competitive salaries and benefits can definitely help an employer attract potential employees. However, a company\'s current workforce must be the focus of significant effort in order to retain talent in the context of \u201c The Great Resignation\\". Employees want to be heard, valued and know that they can grow and evolve within their organization. Employers need to put in place smart, sophisticated strategies to ensure employee satisfaction and retention."},{"id":"back-to-school-back-to-work","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/back-to-school-back-to-work","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-13-back-to-school/index.md","title":"Back to School, Back to Work!","description":"Some high paying gig jobs and where to get them!","date":"2022-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 13, 2022","tags":[{"label":"tips","permalink":"/blog/tags/tips"}],"readingTime":1.345,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Latulipe","title":"Writer","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/393893?v=4","key":"alatulipe"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"back-to-school-back-to-work","title":"Back to School, Back to Work!","authors":["alatulipe"],"tags":["tips"],"image":"./image.jpg"},"prevItem":{"title":"How to Face The Labour Shortage?","permalink":"/blog/how-to-face-the-labour-shortage"},"nextItem":{"title":"Workstaff Helps You Manage Staff in Different Locations","permalink":"/blog/workstaff-helps-you-manage-staff-in-different-locations"}},"content":"Some high paying gig jobs and where to get them!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nAs the summer nears its end, the days get shorter, the nights a little colder, we can feel it in the air, the vacation is over.

Overnight, millions of workers transformed a corner of their homes into a replica of their work environment. The concept of workplace has changed. From a common, central space, it became divided into a multitude of individual, dispersed spaces.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nDespite the suddenness of this change, many have taken to this new setting and the comfort and privacy that comes with it. This new configuration was a real challenge for managers, for whom the distance and separation from their subordinates also meant rethinking how they operated to manage employees and teams in different locations.\\n\\n\\nHowever, this way of working was already in use in other industries before the pandemic. This is the case in the event industry. Many staffing agencies manage armies of workers scattered across different sites and events on a daily basis. Such a task can be daunting and requires a solid and precise organizational and communication structure. This is even more important with the return of countless events following two years of stagnation in this industry during the Covid-19 pandemic.\\n\\n\\nThe implementation of a central working system and structure is fundamental for the efficient management of different sites. It is essential to repeat the work and team structure across all sites and to standardize communication means, procedures and training.\\n\\n\\nThere are many technological solutions that can help you create an organizational structure and ensure the smooth running of your operations, communication and collaboration between your team members. Among them, Workstaff has proven to be a tremendously effective planning, management and communication tool in the event industry, which is characterized by the management of personnel in a number of different locations.\\n\\n\\n## Scheduling and staff management\\nScheduling can be laborious when it has to be applied to multiple teams in different locations. A good scheduling and staff management system with a mobile app is a great asset and offers the ability to schedule employees, make quick changes and communicate with workers regardless of their location.\\n\\n\\nWith its online platform and mobile app, Workstaff offers a range of features that allow you to efficiently plan your staff and schedules.\\n- **Schedule management**: create schedules and shifts and book staff in a few clicks\\n- **Job posting**: easily post jobs for your staff to apply for at your fingertips from the mobile app\\n- **Notifications**: Keep your workers informed of their shift assignments and any changes to their schedule\\n- **Time tracking**: With the mobile app, staff can clock in and out by geolocation or QR code and submit timesheets in minutes. On your end, you can keep track of your employees\' time in real time and easily track their timesheets.\\n\\n## Centralized communication\\nFrom home-based employees to international teams and on-demand staff, clear and effective communication is critical to management.  Many technological solutions facilitating direct communication between team members have become widely popular during the pandemic. Video conferencing and team messaging applications are now an integral part of the business landscape for many organizations and are a must-have tool for communicating with entire teams, connecting employees and encouraging dialogue between them. Good communication encourages collaboration, and even from a distance, it can be fostered with the right tools and features.\\n\\nAmong its many functionalities, Workstaff is equipped with a direct messaging system that allows employers to communicate directly with their staff without going through external communication systems. They can reach employees individually or as a team, no matter where they are, through the mobile application. A broadcasting tool included in the messaging system also allows for the mass sending of messages to the entire staff.\\n\\n## Employee empowerment\\nDelegating is one of the keys to successful remote staffing. After creating a work structure and setting up a system, entrusting tasks to your staff is essential to the smooth running of operations in separate locations. Delegating encourages the potential of employees, balances the different skills of your teams, promotes their sense of involvement in the company and communicates that you trust them. Delegate day-to-day management tasks to assistant managers, supervisors or team leaders, and expand the sense of responsibility of all employees by assigning them tasks that match their roles.\\n\\nWorkstaff allows you to schedule staff for the different shifts you plan and to appoint trusted team leaders who can track the time and attendance of their colleagues at the different sites.\\n\\nLearn more about Workstaff by reading our [**documentation**](https://help.workstaff.app/) about the different features the platform offers."},{"id":"the-gigification-of-work","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-gigification-of-work","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-02-gigification-of-work/index.md","title":"The Gigification of Work","description":"The gigification of work is no longer an emerging phenomenon.

The use of new technologies and the switch to more flexible working arrangements are now commonplace. Many workers are turning to on-demand jobs for the flexibility they can benefit from.\\n\\nIf you rely on on-demand workers, consider using technology tools that have the potential to make it easier to plan your operations and communicate with your temporary staff.\\n\\n[**Learn more about Workstaff and the features you can use to make your operations easier.**](https://workstaff.app/)"},{"id":"product-updates-august-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/product-updates-august-2022","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-11-product-updates/index.md","title":"Product Updates - August 2022","description":"Swap staff, manage clients, invoicing improvements on the mobile app, and some other goodies are on the menu for this update.","date":"2022-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 11, 2022","tags":[{"label":"product updates","permalink":"/blog/tags/product-updates"}],"readingTime":2.575,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"David Marquis","title":"Product Lead","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/393893?v=4","key":"dmarquis"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"product-updates-august-2022","title":"Product Updates - August 2022","authors":["dmarquis"],"tags":["product updates"],"image":"./202208-product-updates.jpg"},"prevItem":{"title":"The Gigification of Work","permalink":"/blog/the-gigification-of-work"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Rebirth of The Event Industry","permalink":"/blog/the-rebirth-of-the-event-industry"}},"content":"Swap staff, manage clients, invoicing improvements on the mobile app, and some other goodies are on the menu for this update.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Swap / Replace Staff\\n\\nPreviously, replacing a staff booked on a schedule was a rather complex endeavour that required many steps:\\n\\n1.
