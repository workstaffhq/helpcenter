Overnight, millions of workers transformed a corner of their homes into a replica of their work environment. The concept of workplace has changed. From a common, central space, it became divided into a multitude of individual, dispersed spaces.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nDespite the suddenness of this change, many have taken to this new setting and the comfort and privacy that comes with it. This new configuration was a real challenge for managers, for whom the distance and separation from their subordinates also meant rethinking how they operated to manage employees and teams in different locations.\\n\\n\\nHowever, this way of working was already in use in other industries before the pandemic. This is the case in the event industry. Many staffing agencies manage armies of workers scattered across different sites and events on a daily basis. Such a task can be daunting and requires a solid and precise organizational and communication structure. This is even more important with the return of countless events following two years of stagnation in this industry during the Covid-19 pandemic.\\n\\n\\nThe implementation of a central working system and structure is fundamental for the efficient management of different sites. It is essential to repeat the work and team structure across all sites and to standardize communication means, procedures and training.\\n\\n\\nThere are many technological solutions that can help you create an organizational structure and ensure the smooth running of your operations, communication and collaboration between your team members. Among them, Workstaff has proven to be a tremendously effective planning, management and communication tool in the event industry, which is characterized by the management of personnel in a number of different locations.\\n\\n\\n## Scheduling and staff management\\nScheduling can be laborious when it has to be applied to multiple teams in different locations. A good scheduling and staff management system with a mobile app is a great asset and offers the ability to schedule employees, make quick changes and communicate with workers regardless of their location.\\n\\n\\nWith its online platform and mobile app, Workstaff offers a range of features that allow you to efficiently plan your staff and schedules.\\n- **Schedule management**: create schedules and shifts and book staff in a few clicks\\n- **Job posting**: easily post jobs for your staff to apply for at your fingertips from the mobile app\\n- **Notifications**: Keep your workers informed of their shift assignments and any changes to their schedule\\n- **Time tracking**: With the mobile app, staff can clock in and out by geolocation or QR code and submit timesheets in minutes. On your end, you can keep track of your employees\' time in real time and easily track their timesheets.\\n\\n## Centralized communication\\nFrom home-based employees to international teams and on-demand staff, clear and effective communication is critical to management.  Many technological solutions facilitating direct communication between team members have become widely popular during the pandemic. Video conferencing and team messaging applications are now an integral part of the business landscape for many organizations and are a must-have tool for communicating with entire teams, connecting employees and encouraging dialogue between them. Good communication encourages collaboration, and even from a distance, it can be fostered with the right tools and features.\\n\\nAmong its many functionalities, Workstaff is equipped with a direct messaging system that allows employers to communicate directly with their staff without going through external communication systems. They can reach employees individually or as a team, no matter where they are, through the mobile application. A broadcasting tool included in the messaging system also allows for the mass sending of messages to the entire staff.\\n\\n## Employee empowerment\\nDelegating is one of the keys to successful remote staffing. After creating a work structure and setting up a system, entrusting tasks to your staff is essential to the smooth running of operations in separate locations. Delegating encourages the potential of employees, balances the different skills of your teams, promotes their sense of involvement in the company and communicates that you trust them. Delegate day-to-day management tasks to assistant managers, supervisors or team leaders, and expand the sense of responsibility of all employees by assigning them tasks that match their roles.\\n\\nWorkstaff allows you to schedule staff for the different shifts you plan and to appoint trusted team leaders who can track the time and attendance of their colleagues at the different sites.\\n\\nLearn more about Workstaff by reading our [documentation about the different features the platform offers](https://help.workstaff.app/)."},{"id":"the-gigification-of-work","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-gigification-of-work","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-02-gigification-of-work/index.md","title":"The Gigification of Work","description":"The gigification of work is no longer an emerging phenomenon.

The search for balance and well-being has led many people to move away from their traditional jobs and towards more independence and flexibility. \\n\\n## An intensifying trend after two years of stillness\\nFollowing the last two years, the gig economy is being further spurred by a mass movement toward self-employment seen across a variety of industries, despite the possibility of a return to workplaces.\\n\\nAs we\'ve observed at Workstaff, a significant number of people who use the platform are on-demand workers and offer their services to a variety of businesses such as staffing agencies, events and festivals, catering services, marketing agencies and sporting events.\\n\\nVia the platform, these workers can easily browse job offers posted by their employer(s) and apply directly from their cell phone.\\n\\n## In a nutshell\\nThe pandemic has brought about profound changes in the professional world. The use of new technologies and the switch to more flexible working arrangements are now commonplace. Many workers are turning to on-demand jobs for the flexibility they can benefit from.\\n\\nIf you rely on on-demand workers, consider using technology tools that have the potential to make it easier to plan your operations and communicate with your temporary staff.\\n\\n[**Learn more about Workstaff and the features you can use to make your operations easier.**](https://workstaff.app/)"},{"id":"product-updates-august-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/product-updates-august-2022","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-11-product-updates/index.md","title":"Product Updates - August 2022","description":"Swap staff, manage clients, invoicing improvements on the mobile app, and some other goodies are on the menu for this update.","date":"2022-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 11, 2022","tags":[{"label":"product updates","permalink":"/blog/tags/product-updates"}],"readingTime":2.575,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"David Marquis","title":"Lead Produit","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/393893?v=4","key":"dmarquis"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"product-updates-august-2022","title":"Product Updates - August 2022","authors":["dmarquis"],"tags":["product updates"],"image":"./202208-product-updates.jpg"},"prevItem":{"title":"The Gigification of Work","permalink":"/blog/the-gigification-of-work"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Rebirth of The Event Industry","permalink":"/blog/the-rebirth-of-the-event-industry"}},"content":"Swap staff, manage clients, invoicing improvements on the mobile app, and some other goodies are on the menu for this update.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Swap / Replace Staff\\n\\nPreviously, replacing a staff booked on a schedule was a rather complex endeavour that required many steps:\\n\\n1.

Indeed, it is possible to virtually attend concerts, conferences, promotional events, conventions, and much more. \\n\\nThe pandemic has accelerated the adoption of technology as a tool for organizing and communicating at events, but also as an integral and essential part of those events. \\n\\nMany companies have embraced this long-term approach and plan to continue offering virtual events even after the health constraints of the pandemic have been alleviated.\\n\\n## The Long Awaited Return of Physical Events\\nHowever, according to recent studies, a large majority of people still prefer physical events to virtual ones for the exchanges, the conviviality and the human experience they offer. \\n\\nThis interest is all the more visible with the return in force of participants to face-to-face gatherings in recent months. Today, with the removal of multiple health constraints, the events sector is experiencing a positive trend. \\n\\nThe disruption has resulted in a significant amount of rescheduling of events that can finally take place, in addition to those that are being organized after the two years of restrictions. \\n\\nCatering services, staffing agencies, event organizers and other players in this sector must now respond to an extremely high demand and implement adequate logistical, organizational and technological means to cope with such a craze.\\n\\n## The Undeniable Advantages of Technology \\nIn a context where it is possible to take advantage of more freedom than during the last two years, the pandemic persists despite everything and the importance of hybrid events is indisputable if one wants to get closer to his audience. \\n\\nThe impact of the pandemic on the event industry has led to a growing use of technological tools that allow the digitization of events, but also their organization and communication. \\n\\nWorkstaff is a platform widely used in the event industry for its functionalities that facilitate, among other things, the management of schedules, the planning of personnel and the communication with the teams. \\n\\nYou can stay informed of your workers\' availability, book them and publish offers they can apply for at their fingertips on the mobile app, thanks to which they are always reachable through instant messaging. \\n\\nThese tools have proven to be particularly beneficial in recent months as the tidal wave of the event industry has overwhelmed. \\n\\nLearn more about Workstaff and its features by visiting our [**Help Center**](https://help.workstaff.app/docs/managers/)."}]}')}}]);
