They are equipped with an infrastructure that enables planning, monitoring and managing tasks as well as communicating with workers and clients through websites and mobile applications.\\n\\nA real craze has grown for a multitude of platforms that support the sale of services, home delivery of food products and transportation.\\n\\n## The increased use of technology during the pandemic\\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, a large volume of businesses and workers had to quickly adapt to a new reality.\\n\\nThe sudden mass embrace of platforms that support the creation of digital workspaces highlighted the adaptability and efficiency of employees in the context of working from home, which then became a norm.\\n\\nThis context has also led to a massive shift in the way people relate to their work. The search for balance and well-being has led many people to move away from their traditional jobs and towards more independence and flexibility.\\n\\n## An intensifying trend after two years of stillness\\nFollowing the last two years, the gig economy is being further spurred by a mass movement toward self-employment seen across a variety of industries, despite the possibility of a return to work environments.\\n\\nAs we\'ve observed at Workstaff, a significant number of people who use the platform work independently and offer their services to a variety of businesses such as staffing agencies, events and festivals, catering services, marketing agencies and sporting events.\\n\\nVia the platform, these workers can easily browse job offers posted by their employer(s) and apply directly from their cell phone.\\n\\n## In a nutshell\\nThe pandemic has brought about profound changes in the professional world. The use of new technologies and the switch to more flexible working arrangements are now commonplace. Many workers are turning to on-demand jobs for the flexibility they can benefit from.\\n\\nIf you rely on on-demand workers, consider using technology tools that have the potential to make it easier to plan your operations and communicate with your temporary staff.\\n\\n[**Learn more about Workstaff and the features you can use to make your operations easier.**](https://workstaff.app/)"},{"id":"product-updates-august-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/product-updates-august-2022","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-11-product-updates/index.md","title":"Product Updates - August 2022","description":"Swap staff, manage clients, invoicing improvements on the mobile app, and some other goodies are on the menu for this update.","date":"2022-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 11, 2022","tags":[{"label":"product updates","permalink":"/blog/tags/product-updates"}],"readingTime":2.575,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"David Marquis","title":"Product Lead","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/393893?v=4","key":"dmarquis"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"product-updates-august-2022","title":"Product Updates - August 2022","authors":["dmarquis"],"tags":["product updates"],"image":"./202208-product-updates.jpg"},"prevItem":{"title":"The Gigification of Work","permalink":"/blog/the-gigification-of-work"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Rebirth of The Event Industry","permalink":"/blog/the-rebirth-of-the-event-industry"}},"content":"Swap staff, manage clients, invoicing improvements on the mobile app, and some other goodies are on the menu for this update.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Swap / Replace Staff\\n\\nPreviously, replacing a staff booked on a schedule was a rather complex endeavour that required many steps:\\n\\n1.

Indeed, it is possible to virtually attend concerts, conferences, promotional events, conventions, and much more. \\n\\nThe pandemic has accelerated the adoption of technology as a tool for organizing and communicating at events, but also as an integral and essential part of those events. \\n\\nMany companies have embraced this long-term approach and plan to continue offering virtual events even after the health constraints of the pandemic have been alleviated.\\n\\n## The Long Awaited Return of Physical Events\\nHowever, according to recent studies, a large majority of people still prefer physical events to virtual ones for the exchanges, the conviviality and the human experience they offer. \\n\\nThis interest is all the more visible with the return in force of participants to face-to-face gatherings in recent months. Today, with the removal of multiple health constraints, the events sector is experiencing a positive trend. \\n\\nThe disruption has resulted in a significant amount of rescheduling of events that can finally take place, in addition to those that are being organized after the two years of restrictions. \\n\\nCatering services, staffing agencies, event organizers and other players in this sector must now respond to an extremely high demand and implement adequate logistical, organizational and technological means to cope with such a craze.\\n\\n## The Undeniable Advantages of Technology \\nIn a context where it is possible to take advantage of more freedom than during the last two years, the pandemic persists despite everything and the importance of hybrid events is indisputable if one wants to get closer to his audience. \\n\\nThe impact of the pandemic on the event industry has led to a growing use of technological tools that allow the digitization of events, but also their organization and communication. \\n\\nWorkstaff is a platform widely used in the event industry for its functionalities that facilitate, among other things, the management of schedules, the planning of personnel and the communication with the teams. \\n\\nYou can stay informed of your workers\' availability, book them and publish offers they can apply for at their fingertips on the mobile app, thanks to which they are always reachable through instant messaging. \\n\\nThese tools have proven to be particularly beneficial in recent months as the tidal wave of the event industry has overwhelmed. \\n\\nLearn more about Workstaff and its features by visiting our [**Help Center**](https://help.workstaff.app/docs/managers/)."}]}')}}]);
