In reality, it is often tedious and ironically wastes countless hours. Using a good clock in and out system has a myriad of benefits for both employers and their staff.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nHere are the key reasons why you should opt for a good punch clock app.\\n\\n## Ensure Accurate Staff Clocking In & Out\\nSimplifying the tracking of work time is one of the main benefits of a clock in and out system. For employers, it significantly reduces the number of tasks related to tracking worker arrivals, hours worked and departures. For employees, such a system allows them to not have to track their work hours, since the system does it for them.\\n\\n## Make Your Staff\u2019s Lives Easier\\nAs technology facilitates more and more daily tasks, using an efficient time tracking system allows employees to save a considerable amount of time. A time and attendance software with a mobile app allows workers to clock in and out in real time and reduces the possibility of errors.\\n\\n\\n## Make Managers\' Jobs Easier\\nWork arrangements are constantly evolving and have undergone a real transformation during the pandemic with the massive switch to work from home and hybrid work. While they offer more comfort and flexibility to workers, they also create challenges for employers when it comes to tracking their staff\u2019s time. The same is true for businesses operating in different locations. A punch clock app makes it possible to track time in multiple locations and make this data accessible to managers no matter where they are.\\n\\n\\n## Make Your Pay Periods More Enjoyable\\nAs we all know, the payroll process can be a slow and tedious process and can easily lead to errors. A time tracking app allows you to accurately track employee hours and ensure that their paychecks match their hours. Using such a system is a huge asset that guarantees time savings and minimizes the risk of errors during the payroll process.\\n\\n\\n## Time Tracking with Workstaff\\nWorkstaff allows your employees to clock in and out of a shift through different options you can choose from.  As an employer, this feature allows you to track your staff\u2019s time in real time.\\n\\n\\n### Customize your Clock In & Out Options\\nThe platform allows you to customize the options related to your team\'s time tracking.\\n- **Do not require timesheets**: by default, timesheets are mandatory for your staff. When this option is checked, timesheet submission will still be allowed, but will not be enforced and clock in reminders will be disabled\\n- **Unrestricted**: each employee can clock in and out by themselves, from their mobile phone, without any restriction\\n- **By QR code only**: clocking in requires staff to scan a QR code associated with the event.\\n- **By Team Leaders Only**: staff will be instructed to check in with team leaders that you have previously designated in the schedule to punch in and out of shifts.\\n\\n\\n### Real-time Attendance Tracking\\nWorkstaff allows you to track your staff\'s time directly from the platform\'s homepage. Staff attendance is automatically updated as workers clock in and out using the mobile app.\\n\\n### Quick Timesheet Submission\\nThe start and end times of staff shifts are automatically transcribed into timesheets that staff can submit from their mobile phones in seconds.\\n\\n### Use of Geolocation Data\\nWorkstaff provides access to the location of workers when they use the application. Their location is captured as they clock in and out and  helps build trust between employers and employees. Enabling this data is an optional option that each worker can choose to enable or not.\\n\\nTo learn more about Workstaff, visit our [**website**](https://workstaff.app) and our [**documentation**](https://help.workstaff.app) about the different features."},{"id":"how-to-overcome-the-labour-shortage","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/how-to-overcome-the-labour-shortage","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-14-how-to-overcome-a-labour-shortage/index.md","title":"How to Overcome The Labour Shortage?","description":"After two years of stagnation for some and turmoil for others, countless people questioned their priorities and working conditions during the pandemic.

Low wages, inflexible work arrangements, lack of growth opportunities, jobs that don\'t reflect workers\' values, too many health risks, etc. The reasons why millions of employees have left their jobs are as varied as they are valid.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThis mass movement, which now spans several countries, first made its mark in the United States in 2021, where 24 million workers quit between April and September. This trend is called \\"The Great Resignation\\". The labor market is more favorable to employees than employers and makes it less daunting than it used to be to leave a job and find a new one. According to a [Statistics Canada study](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/subjects-start/labour_/labour-shortage-trends-canada) on labour shortage trends, the unemployment-to-job vacancy ratio in Canada \\"is historically low\\" and has fallen from 3.2 to 1.4 between the first quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022.\\n\\nA context that primarily benefits employees also presents many challenges for employers who must simultaneously develop strategies to retain staff and be attractive in the labour market.\\n\\nAs an employer, what is the best way to deal with a period of high resignation?\\n\\n## Offer flexible work arrangements\\nThe pandemic was marked by the widespread adoption of remote work, which has become commonplace. In the aftermath of the stringent health measures, preferences for work arrangements differ. Some employees are leaving their jobs because working from home is forced upon them and others because they are required to be in the workplace.\\n\\nToday, it is critical for employers to be adaptable and offer flexible work arrangements. Whether it\'s hybrid or remote work, flexible hours or compressed work weeks, employers are more likely to retain and motivate their workers and attract new ones if they are flexible.\\n\\nIn addition, in a context where the spread of COVID-19 is still a concern, offering these alternatives to employees allows those at risk of complications to have access to safer working conditions.\\n\\n## Offer competitive salaries and benefits\\nIn order to be competitive, it is important that the salaries and benefits offered by a company set it apart and meet the expectations of employees. These elements should be viewed as an investment in attracting and retaining skilled workers who will play a key role in the growth of an organization. According to a [**study conducted by BDC**](https://www.bdc.ca/en/about/analysis-research/labour-shortage) on how to adapt to a labour shortage in September 2021, 41% of employees who were considering leaving their jobs at the time of the study wanted higher salaries, and 21% wanted more benefits.\\n\\n## Invest in the professional development of your employees\\nIn 2022, finding employees with the right skills is particularly difficult. To alleviate this problem, companies can turn to their existing staff by offering them internal training to improve their skills. This strategy is effective in maximizing employees\' potential and encouraging them to develop skills that will allow them to grow within the organization.\\n\\nEmployees are not always aware of the training opportunities available to them within a company, so communicating these opportunities to them is essential. Companies also need to create regular career growth opportunities that match the evolving skills of their staff. Investing in employee growth is a key strategy to foster talent retention.\\n\\n## Make sure employees feel appreciated and valued\\nEmployee satisfaction within an organization is directly linked to higher retention rates, as workers are less likely to be absent or quit. As an employer or manager, it is important to celebrate the individual and collective accomplishments of their staff. Employers should also ensure that they reward behaviours that are encouraged as part of the company culture.\\n\\n## In a nutshell\\nBeing attractive in the job market by offering competitive salaries and benefits can definitely help an employer attract potential employees. However, a company\'s current workforce must be the focus of significant effort in order to retain talent in the context of \u201c The Great Resignation\\". Employees want to be heard, valued and know that they can grow and evolve within their organization. Employers need to put in place smart, sophisticated strategies to ensure employee satisfaction and retention."},{"id":"the-gigification-of-work","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-gigification-of-work","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-02-gigification-of-work/index.md","title":"The Gigification of Work","description":"The gigification of work is no longer an emerging phenomenon.
