In reality, it is often tedious and ironically leads to the waste of countless hours. Using a good time tracking system has a myriad of benefits for both employers and their staff.\\n\\nHere are the key reasons why you should opt for a good time clock app.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Accurate Time Tracking\\nSimplifying time tracking is one of the main benefits of a time tracking app. Using a time clock app allows you to accurately record staff time and reduce the chances of time theft on the job.\\nThe number of manual tasks related to time tracking (data export, data sheets, etc.) and the margin of error associated with these tasks are virtually eliminated.\\n\\nThe employees\u2019 task is also simplified since it does not require any manual tracking on their part. Such a system also serves as proof of attendance at the workplace during scheduled shifts. This allows management to easily and accurately track employee tardiness and absences.\\n\\n## Employee Accountability\\nAs technology facilitates more and more daily tasks, adopting an effective timekeeping system is a significant advantage for employees. It also encourages them to take responsibility for their time-related activities.\\n\\nTraining and empowering staff to track their own time allows the company to take some burden off of themselves and encourages employees to understand the direct link between proper time management and accurate compensation.\\n\\n## Simplification of the Payroll Process\\nAs we all know, payroll processing can be a slow and tedious process and can easily lead to errors. A good time clock app tracks worked hours accurately and ensures that the wages paid to employees accurately reflect the amount they are owed.\\n\\nUsing a timekeeping system is a huge time-saving asset that reduces the risk of errors in the payroll process. Besides, such accuracy helps build trust between management and employees.\\n\\n## Making Managers\' Jobs Easier\\nWork arrangements are constantly evolving and have undergone a real transformation during the pandemic with the massive adoption of remote and hybrid work. While they offer more comfort and flexibility to workers, they also create challenges for employers when it comes to tracking the time of their staff.\\n\\nThe same is true for businesses operating in different locations. A time tracking app can keep staff informed of their work schedules and make time tracking in multiple locations accessible to managers no matter where they are located.\\n\\n\\n## In a Nutshell\\nA good time clock system allows you to do much more than just track your employees\' time; it can also ensure pay accuracy, and be a great asset for companies looking to improve productivity and save time.\\n\\nAmong its many features, Workstaff comes with a mobile app that allows employees to clock in and out of their shifts in seconds. The platform allows you to track your workers\' hours in real time, reminds your staff to submit their timesheets and even allows autonomous workers to submit their invoices based on approved hours.\\n\\n[**Visit our website**](https://workstaff.app/) to learn more about Workstaff and the features you can benefit from to facilitate your operations."},{"id":"how-to-overcome-the-labour-shortage","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/how-to-overcome-the-labour-shortage","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-14-how-to-overcome-a-labour-shortage/index.md","title":"How to Overcome The Labour Shortage?","description":"After two years of stagnation for some and turmoil for others, countless people questioned their priorities and working conditions during the pandemic.

Low wages, inflexible work arrangements, lack of growth opportunities, jobs that don\'t reflect workers\' values, too many health risks, etc. The reasons why millions of employees have left their jobs are as varied as they are valid.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThis mass movement, which now spans several countries, first made its mark in the United States in 2021, where 24 million workers quit between April and September. This trend is called \\"The Great Resignation\\". The labor market is more favorable to employees than employers and makes it less daunting than it used to be to leave a job and find a new one. According to a [Statistics Canada study](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/subjects-start/labour_/labour-shortage-trends-canada) on labour shortage trends, the unemployment-to-job vacancy ratio in Canada \\"is historically low\\" and has fallen from 3.2 to 1.4 between the first quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022.\\n\\nA context that primarily benefits employees also presents many challenges for employers who must simultaneously develop strategies to retain staff and be attractive in the labour market.\\n\\nAs an employer, what is the best way to deal with a period of high resignation?\\n\\n## Offer flexible work arrangements\\nThe pandemic was marked by the widespread adoption of remote work, which has become commonplace. In the aftermath of the stringent health measures, preferences for work arrangements differ. Some employees are leaving their jobs because working from home is forced upon them and others because they are required to be in the workplace.\\n\\nToday, it is critical for employers to be adaptable and offer flexible work arrangements. Whether it\'s hybrid or remote work, flexible hours or compressed work weeks, employers are more likely to retain and motivate their workers and attract new ones if they are flexible.\\n\\nIn addition, in a context where the spread of COVID-19 is still a concern, offering these alternatives to employees allows those at risk of complications to have access to safer working conditions.\\n\\n## Offer competitive salaries and benefits\\nIn order to be competitive, it is important that the salaries and benefits offered by a company set it apart and meet the expectations of employees. These elements should be viewed as an investment in attracting and retaining skilled workers who will play a key role in the growth of an organization. According to a [**study conducted by BDC**](https://www.bdc.ca/en/about/analysis-research/labour-shortage) on how to adapt to a labour shortage in September 2021, 41% of employees who were considering leaving their jobs at the time of the study wanted higher salaries, and 21% wanted more benefits.\\n\\n## Invest in the professional development of your employees\\nIn 2022, finding employees with the right skills is particularly difficult. To alleviate this problem, companies can turn to their existing staff by offering them internal training to improve their skills. This strategy is effective in maximizing employees\' potential and encouraging them to develop skills that will allow them to grow within the organization.\\n\\nEmployees are not always aware of the training opportunities available to them within a company, so communicating these opportunities to them is essential. Companies also need to create regular career growth opportunities that match the evolving skills of their staff. Investing in employee growth is a key strategy to foster talent retention.\\n\\n## Make sure employees feel appreciated and valued\\nEmployee satisfaction within an organization is directly linked to higher retention rates, as workers are less likely to be absent or quit. As an employer or manager, it is important to celebrate the individual and collective accomplishments of their staff. Employers should also ensure that they reward behaviours that are encouraged as part of the company culture.\\n\\n## In a nutshell\\nBeing attractive in the job market by offering competitive salaries and benefits can definitely help an employer attract potential employees. However, a company\'s current workforce must be the focus of significant effort in order to retain talent in the context of \u201c The Great Resignation\\". Employees want to be heard, valued and know that they can grow and evolve within their organization. Employers need to put in place smart, sophisticated strategies to ensure employee satisfaction and retention."},{"id":"the-gigification-of-work","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-gigification-of-work","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-02-gigification-of-work/index.md","title":"The Gigification of Work","description":"The gigification of work is no longer an emerging phenomenon.

The search for balance and well-being has led many people to move away from their traditional jobs and towards more independence and flexibility. \\n\\n## An intensifying trend after two years of stillness\\nFollowing the last two years, the gig economy is being further spurred by a mass movement toward self-employment seen across a variety of industries, despite the possibility of a return to workplaces.\\n\\nAs we\'ve observed at Workstaff, a significant number of people who use the platform are on-demand workers and offer their services to a variety of businesses such as staffing agencies, events and festivals, catering services, marketing agencies and sporting events.\\n\\nVia the platform, these workers can easily browse job offers posted by their employer(s) and apply directly from their cell phone.\\n\\n## In a nutshell\\nThe pandemic has brought about profound changes in the professional world. The use of new technologies and the switch to more flexible working arrangements are now commonplace. Many workers are turning to on-demand jobs for the flexibility they can benefit from.\\n\\nIf you rely on on-demand workers, consider using technology tools that have the potential to make it easier to plan your operations and communicate with your temporary staff.\\n\\n[**Learn more about Workstaff and the features you can use to make your operations easier.**](https://workstaff.app/)"},{"id":"product-updates-august-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/product-updates-august-2022","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-11-product-updates/index.md","title":"Product Updates - August 2022","description":"Swap staff, manage clients, invoicing improvements on the mobile app, and some other goodies are on the menu for this update.","date":"2022-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 11, 2022","tags":[{"label":"product updates","permalink":"/blog/tags/product-updates"}],"readingTime":2.575,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"David Marquis","title":"Product Lead","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/393893?v=4","key":"dmarquis"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"product-updates-august-2022","title":"Product Updates - August 2022","authors":["dmarquis"],"tags":["product updates"],"image":"./202208-product-updates.jpg"},"prevItem":{"title":"The Gigification of Work","permalink":"/blog/the-gigification-of-work"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Rebirth of The Event Industry","permalink":"/blog/the-rebirth-of-the-event-industry"}},"content":"Swap staff, manage clients, invoicing improvements on the mobile app, and some other goodies are on the menu for this update.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Swap / Replace Staff\\n\\nPreviously, replacing a staff booked on a schedule was a rather complex endeavour that required many steps:\\n\\n1.

Indeed, it is possible to virtually attend concerts, conferences, promotional events, conventions, and much more. \\n\\nThe pandemic has accelerated the adoption of technology as a tool for organizing and communicating at events, but also as an integral and essential part of those events. \\n\\nMany companies have embraced this long-term approach and plan to continue offering virtual events even after the health constraints of the pandemic have been alleviated.\\n\\n## The Long Awaited Return of Physical Events\\nHowever, according to recent studies, a large majority of people still prefer physical events to virtual ones for the exchanges, the conviviality and the human experience they offer. \\n\\nThis interest is all the more visible with the return in force of participants to face-to-face gatherings in recent months. Today, with the removal of multiple health constraints, the events sector is experiencing a positive trend. \\n\\nThe disruption has resulted in a significant amount of rescheduling of events that can finally take place, in addition to those that are being organized after the two years of restrictions. \\n\\nCatering services, staffing agencies, event organizers and other players in this sector must now respond to an extremely high demand and implement adequate logistical, organizational and technological means to cope with such a craze.\\n\\n## The Undeniable Advantages of Technology \\nIn a context where it is possible to take advantage of more freedom than during the last two years, the pandemic persists despite everything and the importance of hybrid events is indisputable if one wants to get closer to his audience. \\n\\nThe impact of the pandemic on the event industry has led to a growing use of technological tools that allow the digitization of events, but also their organization and communication. \\n\\nWorkstaff is a platform widely used in the event industry for its functionalities that facilitate, among other things, the management of schedules, the planning of personnel and the communication with the teams. \\n\\nYou can stay informed of your workers\' availability, book them and publish offers they can apply for at their fingertips on the mobile app, thanks to which they are always reachable through instant messaging. \\n\\nThese tools have proven to be particularly beneficial in recent months as the tidal wave of the event industry has overwhelmed. \\n\\nLearn more about Workstaff and its features by visiting our [**Help Center**](https://help.workstaff.app/docs/managers/)."}]}')}}]);
