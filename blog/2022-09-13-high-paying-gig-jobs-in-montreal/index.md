If you're tired of working for minimum wage, even though it's been rising steadily but never enough to keep up with inflation, which has reached unsustainable levels in recent months, rest assured: there are other opportunities out there!

With the end of the Covid-19 restrictions, festivals, concerts, weddings, conventions and conferences are making a comeback. Event producers, large and small, often use staffing agencies that have a pool of part-time candidates that they usually pay well. Providing waiters for caterers or promotional staff to hand out flyers, workers can pick their jobs, locations and dates, giving them a great deal of freedom, and pay typically ranges from $18 to $30 per hour.

Staffing agencies usually have their niches for the industries they provide, but are always looking for new talent with different levels of experience. If you're interested in flexible hours, good pay, and the chance to participate in some of Montreal's most exciting events, check out some of these agencies.
