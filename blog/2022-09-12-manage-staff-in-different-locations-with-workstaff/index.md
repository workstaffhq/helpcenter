# Manage Staff in Different Locations With Workstaff 

Many companies have had to adopt new ways of working during the pandemic. Overnight, millions of workers transformed a corner of their homes into a replica of their work environment. The concept of workplace has changed. From a common, central space, it became divided into a multitude of individual, dispersed spaces.

Despite the suddenness of this change, many have taken to this new setting and the comfort and privacy that comes with it. This new configuration was a real challenge for managers, for whom the distance and separation from their subordinates also meant rethinking how they operated to manage employees and teams in different locations.


However, this way of working was already in use in other industries before the pandemic. This is the case in the event industry. Many staffing agencies manage armies of workers scattered across different sites and events on a daily basis. Such a task can be daunting and requires a solid and precise organizational and communication structure. This is even more important with the return of countless events following two years of stagnation in this industry during the Covid-19 pandemic.


The implementation of a central working system and structure is fundamental for the efficient management of different sites. It is essential to repeat the work and team structure across all sites and to standardize communication means, procedures and training.


There are many technological solutions that can help you create an organizational structure and ensure the smooth running of your operations, communication and collaboration between your team members. Among them, Workstaff has proven to be a tremendously effective planning, management and communication tool in the event industry, which is characterized by the management of personnel in a number of different locations.


## Scheduling and staff management
Scheduling can be laborious when it has to be applied to multiple teams in different locations. A good scheduling and staff management system with a mobile app is a great asset and offers the ability to schedule employees, make quick changes and communicate with workers regardless of their location.


With its online platform and mobile app, Workstaff offers a range of features that allow you to efficiently plan your staff and schedules.
- **Schedule management**: create schedules and shifts and book staff in a few clicks
- **Job posting**: easily post jobs for your staff to apply for at your fingertips from the mobile app
- **Notifications**: Keep your workers informed of their shift assignments and any changes to their schedule
- **Time tracking**: With the mobile app, staff can clock in and out by geolocation or QR code and submit timesheets in minutes. On your end, you can keep track of your employees' time in real time and easily track their timesheets.

## Centralized communication
From home-based employees to international teams and on-demand staff, clear and effective communication is critical to management.  Many technological solutions facilitating direct communication between team members have become widely popular during the pandemic. Video conferencing and team messaging applications are now an integral part of the business landscape for many organizations and are a must-have tool for communicating with entire teams, connecting employees and encouraging dialogue between them. Good communication encourages collaboration, and even from a distance, it can be fostered with the right tools and features.

Among its many functionalities, Workstaff is equipped with a direct messaging system that allows employers to communicate directly with their staff without going through external communication systems. They can reach employees individually or as a team, no matter where they are, through the mobile application. A broadcasting tool included in the messaging system also allows for the mass sending of messages to the entire staff.

## Employee empowerment
Delegating is one of the keys to successful remote staffing. After creating a work structure and setting up a system, entrusting tasks to your staff is essential to the smooth running of operations in separate locations. Delegating encourages the potential of employees, balances the different skills of your teams, promotes their sense of involvement in the company and communicates that you trust them. Delegate day-to-day management tasks to assistant managers, supervisors or team leaders, and expand the sense of responsibility of all employees by assigning them tasks that match their roles.

Workstaff allows you to schedule staff for the different shifts you plan and to appoint trusted team leaders who can track the time and attendance of their colleagues at the different sites.
