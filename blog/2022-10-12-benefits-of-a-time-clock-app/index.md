# The Benefits of a Punch Clock App

Managing workforce time and attendance is an essential task that is supposed to be simple and efficient. In reality, it is often tedious and ironically wastes countless hours. Using a good clock in and out system has a myriad of benefits for both employers and their staff.

Here are the key reasons why you should opt for a good punch clock app.

## Ensure Accurate Staff Clocking In & Out
Simplifying the tracking of work time is one of the main benefits of a clock in and out system. For employers, it significantly reduces the number of tasks related to tracking worker arrivals, hours worked and departures. For employees, such a system allows them to not have to track their work hours, since the system does it for them.

## Make Your Staff’s Lives Easier
As technology facilitates more and more daily tasks, using an efficient time tracking system allows employees to save a considerable amount of time. A time and attendance software with a mobile app allows workers to clock in and out in real time and reduces the possibility of errors.


## Make Managers' Jobs Easier
Work arrangements are constantly evolving and have undergone a real transformation during the pandemic with the massive switch to work from home and hybrid work. While they offer more comfort and flexibility to workers, they also create challenges for employers when it comes to tracking their staff’s time. The same is true for businesses operating in different locations. A punch clock app makes it possible to track time in multiple locations and make this data accessible to managers no matter where they are.


## Make Your Pay Periods More Enjoyable
As we all know, the payroll process can be a slow and tedious process and can easily lead to errors. A time tracking app allows you to accurately track employee hours and ensure that their paychecks match their hours. Using such a system is a huge asset that guarantees time savings and minimizes the risk of errors during the payroll process.


## Time Tracking with Workstaff
Workstaff allows your employees to clock in and out of a shift through different options you can choose from.  As an employer, this feature allows you to track your staff’s time in real time.


### Customize your Clock In & Out Options
The platform allows you to customize the options related to your team's time tracking.
**Do not require timesheets**: by default, timesheets are mandatory for your staff. When this option is checked, timesheet submission will still be allowed, but will not be enforced and clock in reminders will be disabled
**Unrestricted**: each employee can clock in and out by themselves, from their mobile phone, without any restriction
**By QR code only**: clocking in requires staff to scan a QR code associated with the event.
**By Team Leaders Only**: staff will be instructed to check in with team leaders that you have previously designated in the schedule to punch in and out of shifts.


### Real-time Attendance Tracking
Workstaff allows you to track your staff's time directly from the platform's homepage. Staff attendance is automatically updated as workers clock in and out using the mobile app.

### Quick Timesheet Submission
The start and end times of staff shifts are automatically transcribed into timesheets that staff can submit from their mobile phones in seconds.

### Use of Geolocation Data
Workstaff provides access to the location of workers when they use the application. Their location is captured as they clock in and out and  helps build trust between employers and employees. Enabling this data is an optional option that each worker can choose to enable or not.
