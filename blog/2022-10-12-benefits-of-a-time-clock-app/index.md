# The Benefits of an Employee Time Clock App

Managing workforce time is an essential task that should be simple and efficient. In reality, it is often tedious and ironically leads to the waste of countless hours. Using a good time tracking system has a myriad of benefits for both employers and their staff.

Here are the key reasons why you should opt for a good time clock app.

## Accurate Time Tracking
Simplifying time tracking is one of the main benefits of a time tracking app. Using a time clock app allows you to accurately record staff time and reduce the chances of time theft on the job.
The number of manual tasks related to time tracking (data export, data sheets, etc.) and the margin of error associated with these tasks are virtually eliminated.

The employeesâ€™ task is also simplified since it does not require any manual tracking on their part. Such a system also serves as proof of attendance at the workplace during scheduled shifts. This allows management to easily and accurately track employee tardiness and absences.

## Employee Accountability
As technology facilitates more and more daily tasks, adopting an effective timekeeping system is a significant advantage for employees. It also encourages them to take responsibility for their time-related activities.

Training and empowering staff to track their own time allows the company to take some burden off of themselves and encourages employees to understand the direct link between proper time management and accurate compensation.

## Simplification of the Payroll Process
As we all know, payroll processing can be a slow and tedious process and can easily lead to errors. A good time clock app tracks worked hours accurately and ensures that the wages paid to employees accurately reflect the amount they are owed.

Using a timekeeping system is a huge time-saving asset that reduces the risk of errors in the payroll process. Besides, such accuracy helps build trust between management and employees.

## Making Managers' Jobs Easier
Work arrangements are constantly evolving and have undergone a real transformation during the pandemic with the massive adoption of remote and hybrid work. While they offer more comfort and flexibility to workers, they also create challenges for employers when it comes to tracking the time of their staff.

The same is true for businesses operating in different locations. A time tracking app can keep staff informed of their work schedules and make time tracking in multiple locations accessible to managers no matter where they are located.


## In a Nutshell
A good time clock system allows you to do much more than just track your employees' time; it can also ensure pay accuracy, and be a great asset for companies looking to improve productivity and save time.

Among its many features, Workstaff comes with a mobile app that allows employees to clock in and out of their shifts in seconds. The platform allows you to track your workers' hours in real time, reminds your staff to submit their timesheets and even allows autonomous workers to submit their invoices based on approved hours.
