# The Gigification of Work 

The gigification of work is no longer an emerging phenomenon. It reflects a profound shift in global values and is characterized by the use of digital platforms that allow freelancers to offer short-term services and communicate directly with their clients.

These platforms are also a valuable tool for organizations that want to easily assign short-term positions to freelancers.

## A shift towards automation
Over the past few years, the gig economy has attracted a large audience that wants more flexibility and professional autonomy.

Numerous platforms that facilitate this automation of services have emerged and have been rapidly adopted. They are equipped with an infrastructure that enables planning, monitoring and managing tasks as well as communicating with workers and clients through websites and mobile applications.

A real craze has grown for a multitude of platforms that support the sale of services, home delivery of food products and transportation.

## The increased use of technology during the pandemic
As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, a large volume of businesses and workers had to quickly adapt to a new reality.

The sudden mass embrace of platforms that support the creation of digital workspaces highlighted the adaptability and efficiency of employees in the context of working from home, which then became a norm.

This context has also led to a massive shift in the way people relate to their work. The search for balance and well-being has led many people to move away from their traditional jobs and towards more independence and flexibility.

## An intensifying trend after two years of stillness
Following the last two years, the gig economy is being further spurred by a mass movement toward self-employment seen across a variety of industries, despite the possibility of a return to work environments.

As we've observed at Workstaff, a significant number of people who use the platform work independently and offer their services to a variety of businesses such as staffing agencies, events and festivals, catering services, marketing agencies and sporting events.

Via the platform, these workers can easily browse job offers posted by their employer(s) and apply directly from their cell phone.

## In a nutshell
The pandemic has brought about profound changes in the professional world. The use of new technologies and the switch to more flexible working arrangements are now commonplace. Many workers are turning to on-demand jobs for the flexibility they can benefit from.

If you rely on on-demand workers, consider using technology tools that have the potential to make it easier to plan your operations and communicate with your temporary staff.
