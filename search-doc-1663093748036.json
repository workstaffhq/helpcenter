As the summer nears its end, the days get shorter, the nights a little colder, we can feel it in the air, the vacation is over. It’s back to school! Returning to university for many students means buying books, supplies, laptops, transit passes and more often than not student debt. If you are tired of working at minimum wage, even though it keeps on rising but never enough to beat the never ending inflation which has grown to unsustainable levels in the last few months, feel reassured: there are other opportunities out there! With the end of Covid-19 restrictions, festivals, concerts, weddings, conventions, conferences are all back in action. Big and small event producers often rely on staffing agencies who have a pool of part-time candidates that they usually pay well.
