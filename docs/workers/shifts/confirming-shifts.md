# Confirm Your Schedules

When your employer books you for a shift or whenever changes are made to your schedule, Workstaff sends you a notification 
to request a confirmation of your work schedule. 

:::important
Is is important to respond to confirmation requests quickly. This will let your employer
know you're aware and committed, but it will also give them time to react should your availability change.

1. In the **Today** tab, scroll down to **Things To Do**
2. Tap on **Confirm a future work schedule**
3. **Confirm** or **Decline** the shift  
4. **Send the confirmation** to your manager

## What If I Change My Mind?

If you confirm a shift but for any reason can't make it and need to cancel, **get in touch with your manager directly as 
soon as possible**. Not showing up for a shift your previously confirmed will undeniably damage your reputation and might 
have a very negative impact on your relation with your employer.
