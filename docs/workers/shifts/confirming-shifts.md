# Confirm your work schedules

When your employer has booked you for a shift, you are asked to confirm your work schedule. This will let your employer know you're aware and committed, but it will also give them time to react should your availability change.  

1. In the **Today** tab, scroll down to **Things To Do**
2. Tap on **Confirm a future work schedule**
3. **Confirm** or **Decline** the shift  
4. **Send the confirmation** to your manager
