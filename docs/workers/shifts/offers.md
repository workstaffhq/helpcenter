You can easily scroll through new work offers and apply to them in the **Find Offers** tab.

1. See all new offers in the **New** tab
2. Tap an offer to read more about the shift or shifts
3. Tap on **Apply** to submit your application. Confirm your availability for each shift of the offer and tap **Apply** again to confirm
4. You can also tap **Skip this offer** to hide it.  

Once you submit your application the event organizer will receive it, and you'll get notified if they select you for the position.

## Offers Youâ€™ve Applied For

Once you apply to a work offer, its shifts will appear in your main agenda as items with an **Applied** status (yellow dots and cards).

You can also see a list of all active offers you've applied for by going to the **Applied** tab in the main **Find Offers** section. 

When opening an application, you can:

- **Withdraw your application** if you changed your mind or become unavailable for this work
- **Message the organizer** in case you have any question regarding offer.
