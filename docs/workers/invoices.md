# Sending Invoices
Once you have submitted your hours and they've been approved, Workstaff allows you to easily send invoices to your employer.

## Accessing your invoices
You can access your invoices in the following sections of the mobile app: 
- Tap on **Send your invoice for X past shift(s)** under **Things To Do**
- Find all your invoices under the **Profile** tab, in the **Invoicing** section

## Filling-in and sending an invoice
1. Click on **+** next to the invoice to open it in **Draft Mode**
2. Verify and/or edit the invoice information 
3. You can **Add a line** to fill in any additional invoicing information related to your shift
4. Press **Send** when the information is correct and you're ready to submit your invoice

The information you filled in is saved in draft mode until you send the invoice. 

## Invoicing process 
Once your invoice has been sent, you will be able to view the progress of the process, including the **sending**, **approval** and **payment** steps.

## Additional information 
- If you have worked on multiple shifts within a same event, they will be consolidated in different lines within the same invoice. 
- If you can send your invoice, contact your manager to make sure the hours you submitted have been approved.
