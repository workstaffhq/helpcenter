# Sync your Workstaff calendar with your personal calendar

It is now possible to sync your Workstaff calendar with your personal calendar (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, etc.). This allows you to view your shifts directly in your usual calendar.  

## Add the Workstaff calendar

In the **Calendar** tab of your application, tap **Subscribe** at the top right of your screen.  
Then, depending on your operating system (Android or iOS) and your calendar app, follow these steps:  

### Android  

#### Google Calendar (recommended)  
1. Copy the subscription link from the **Subscribe to calendar** page in the Workstaff app.  
2. Open the **Google Calendar** app on your device.  
3. Tap the **Menu (â˜°)** icon, then go to **Settings**.  
4. Select **Add account** then **Other**.  
5. Paste the Workstaff subscription link (for example: `https://app.workstaff.com/calendar/subscribe/[your-unique-code].ics`).  
6. Tap **Add calendar**.  

Your schedule will automatically appear in Google Calendar.  

#### Alternative: add directly via URL  
If you are using another calendar app besides Google Calendar:  
1. Copy the subscription link from the **Subscribe to calendar** page in the Workstaff app.  
2. In your calendar app, look for **Add calendar** or **Subscribe**.  
3. Select **Add by URL** or **Internet Calendar**.  
4. Paste the Workstaff subscription link and confirm the subscription.  

### iPhone (Apple Calendar)  
1. Tap **Subscribe to calendar** to open the app.  
2. Confirm the subscription in your iPhoneâ€™s Calendar app.  

Your schedule will automatically appear in the **Calendar** app on your iPhone.  

:::caution  
Your schedule updates automatically when changes are made in Workstaff.  
However, synchronization with your personal calendar may take **24 to 48 hours** to reflect updates.  

ðŸ‘‰ The calendar built into the Workstaff app (the **Calendar** tab) is always updated in real time.  
This is therefore the main reference to check your schedule.
