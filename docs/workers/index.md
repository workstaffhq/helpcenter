# Help for Workers

This area is the place to learn everything you need to know about using Workstaff to interact with your employer effectively.

## Who Is Workstaff for?

Workstaff is used by employers to manage their team's work schedules and much more. As a worker, you will use Workstaff to 
see your detailed work schedule, 
**[communicate your availability](manage-your-schedule/availability.md), 
[stay in touch with your team(s)](./messaging.md), 
[apply to work offers and open shifts](./shifts/offers.md), 
[track your time](./manage-your-time/clockin.md)**
and more.

:::info Workstaff is by invitation only
You cannot create a Workstaff account by yourself. You first need to get invited by an employer before you can sign in and 
claim your account.
