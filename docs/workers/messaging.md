# Sending Messages

Workstaff allows you to communicate with your managers and your teams via instant messaging. You can access all your conversations in the **Messages** tab.

## Messaging an Organizer 
When opening a work offer under the **Find Offers** tab, you can easily reach out to the organizer if you have any question by tapping on the messaging icon next to the organizer's name, or by tapping the **Message the organizer** button at the bottom of the screen. 

## Team Chat 
In order to message the entire team on an event you're booked on, tap on **Team Chat** in the **Today** tab to message your team working on today's event.
