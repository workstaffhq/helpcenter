# Reporting Your Time 

Once a shift is completed, you will be instructed to **Report your time on a past shift** under **Things To Do** in the **Today** tab.   

You can also access your timesheets to submit by going to the **Profile** tab and then pressing on **Time Tracking**. 

## Submit a Time Entry

You have an opportunity to submit your time right after you clock out of a shift. In case you can't submit the time at this moment,
you can access all of your time entries by going to the **Profile** tab and then pressing on **Time Tracking**.

Once you press **Submit Time** on any time entry, the default **Start Time** and **End Time** displayed are the times you 
clocked in and out, or the planned work times if you forgot to clock in and out. 

Make sure the schedule, break time and travel distance (if applicable) are correct and tap **Submit**. 

## Approval Process

Once you have submitted your time, the time entry may need to be reviewed by your employer. During that review, they may 
decide to correct your time, in which case the correction will be displayed in your work log.

## Invoice Your Hours

If you are an Autonomous Worker or Contractor and your employer is on a Workstaff plan that allows invoices, you will be able to 
[create an invoice](../invoices.md) for your approved hours right from the mobile app in a single tap.
