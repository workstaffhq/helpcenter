# Reporting your time 
After clocking out of a shift, you will be instructed to **Report your time on a past shift** under **Things To Do** in the **Today** tab.   
You can also access your timesheets to submit by going to the **Profile** tab and then pressing on **Time Tracking**. 

## Submit your time
When you open a timesheet, the default **Start Time** and **End Time** displayed are the times you clocked in and out. Check your hours and your break time and click on **Submit X H**. Once you have submitted your time, your timesheets are to be approved by your employer. After they have been approved, you will be able to send an invoice for these hours from the mobile app.
