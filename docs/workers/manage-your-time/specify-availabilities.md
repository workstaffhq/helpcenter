# Specifying your availability
One of the first things you'll need to do after completing your profile is specifying your availabilities. This will help your manager easily book you on days you are free to work.

Specifying your availability is a simple task:
1. Go to the **Profile** tab and tap on **My Availability**.
2. Select a date and specify whether you are available or not
3. If you are available, select whether you are available **All Day**, during **Specific Periods** or during **Specific Times**

Once you have specified your availability on specific dates, they are highlighted as follows in your **Agenda**:
- Green: Available
- Red: Not Available
