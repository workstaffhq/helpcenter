# Clock in and out of shifts
The Workstaff app allows you to clock in and out of your shifts at the tip of your fingers.
Based on your employer's chosen time tracking method, you are able to track your time in the ways listed below. 

## Clock in and out without restrictions
You will be able to clock in and out of shifts by yourself upon arriving at the shift location, at the beginning of your shift. When opening the mobile app at the beginning of your shift, you will be instructed to clock in on the **Today** tab.

## Scan a QR code 
If your employer has chosen this time tracking method, you will be instructed to scan each eventâ€™s QR code to clock in and out of shifts.

## Clock in and out via your team lead
In this case, you will be instructed to go see a team lead in person so they can clock in and out for you, from their mobile phone. 

If you are a team lead on a project, you can clock your teammates in and out by following these steps: 
1. In the **Today** tab, tap on **Track Time** 
2. At the beginning of the shift, when your teammates come to you, tap on **Clock In** next to their name
3. At the end of the shift, tap on **Clock out** next to their name when they are leaving their shift
