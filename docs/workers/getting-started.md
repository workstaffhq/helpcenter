# Getting started 

Before you start using Workstaff, there are a few key steps to claim your profile and provide information that will be useful to your employer.

1. Open the app and select whether you wish to log in using your mobile phone or email address 
2. Enter the sign in code you'll receive either by email or text depending on the login option you chose. This code will be valid for 10 minutes. 
3. You are now logged in!
