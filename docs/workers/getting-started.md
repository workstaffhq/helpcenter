The first time you use Workstaff, you'll be asked to fill in some general information about yourself such as: 

- Your **name**
- Your **home city**
- Your **birthdate**
- Your **gender**
- Your **skills** - those will be used as suggestions for your employer, and will allow you to receive personalized work offers that match your actual skills.
- Provide a profile picture 

## Provide Additional Information About Yourself

After you complete the initial questionnaire, you can go to the **Profile** tab if you wish to edit your basic information or add more such as:

- A short presentation text about you

- Details about your transportation options and preferences

This additional information is optional but providing it allows your employer to send you work offers that better match your individual profile.
