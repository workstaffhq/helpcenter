# How can I clear/reset the Workstaff mobile app data

In some circumstances, you might need to clear all Workstaff data on your phone to reset it. Deleting the Workstaff data on your phone does not affect your Workstaff account, bookings and history in any way; all data is always stored on Workstaff servers and some data is kept on your phone to make the app responsive while you use it.

### For Android

To reset the Workstaff data on Android:

1. Make sure the Workstaff mobile app is closed.
2. Open the **Settings** app on your phone.
3. Select **Apps and notifications**
4. Select **Workstaff** under **Recent applications**
5. Select **Storage and Cache**
6. Click the **Reset data** button.
7. Launch Workstaff and you should be presented with the login screen, which means your data was properly reset.

### For iOS / iPhone?

iOS / iPhone does not allow to clear only the data of apps. Instead, you need to delete the app and re-install it from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/workstaff/id1458402928?ls=1).
