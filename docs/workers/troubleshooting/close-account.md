**Receiving too many or unwanted notifications?** You can deactivate all Workstaff notifications by going to the Profile tab of the app, then scrolling down to **Preferences** / **Notifications**.
:::

If you want to close your Workstaff account, please contact your employer first — they’ll be able to end your work relationship directly.
If you have any questions or need help after that, feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:support@workstaff.app">support@workstaff.app</a>. 

Make sure the email comes from the email address associated with your Workstaff account and contains your name as it appears on your account so that we can ensure the authenticity of your request.

When you close your Workstaff account, the following happens:
1. All of your personal profile data (ex: profile picture, bio, skills, work experience, availability, etc.) is deleted.
2. Your employers are informed that you cannot access the Workstaff mobile app anymore and can't interact with them.
3. Your employers keep your work history, chat conversations, invoices and all other historical data they need to keep for legal and operational purposes.

:::caution
When your account is closed, you will lose access to all of your work history, chat conversations, invoices (if applicable), and all other data associated to your worker account.
Make sure you safely stored any important data elsewhere before requesting to close your account.
