# I Can't Log In

## Problem 
In some instances, you may not be able to log in. In most cases we've observed this can be due to the reasons listed below:

- Your employer hasn't created an account for you yet
- Your contact information may not be correct in the profile created by your employer
- The contact information you entered upon logging in may be incorrect 

## Solution
When entering your contact information to log in, make sure to type it yourself rather than copying and pasting it.

If you are unable to log in, to contact your employer to make sure they have created a profile for you and that your contact information is correct.
