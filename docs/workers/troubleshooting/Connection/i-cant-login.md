# I Can't Log In

## Problem 
In some instances, you may not be able to log in. In most cases we've observed this can be due to the reasons listed below:

- Your employer hasn't created an account for you yet
- Your contact information may not be correct in the profile created by your employer
- The contact information you entered upon logging in may be incorrect 

## Solution
The first thing youâ€™ll need to do if you are unable to log in is to contact your employer to make sure they have created a profile for you and that the contact information is correct.

When entering your contact information to log in, make sure to type it yourself rather than copying and pasting it.
