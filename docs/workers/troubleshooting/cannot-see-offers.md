# I Can't See Published Offers 

## Distance Issue 
Sometimes you may not be able to see the jobs in the **Find Offers tab**.
In most of the cases we observed, this was due to the fact that the distance between the shift location and the location registered in the worker's profile was too great.  By default, an offer is published to the staff located withtin 100km from the shift location.

This is usually fixed by changing the location in your profile. 

1. Open your app and go to the **Profile** tab 
2. Tap on your name 
3. Tap on **Basic Information**
4. Change the **Home City** to the city closest to the shifts you work on. 

## No skills associated with the profile
Sometimes this problem occurs because no skills have been added to your profile.
In this case, contact your employer to make sure skills have been added to your profile.
