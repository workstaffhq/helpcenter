# Organizing & Classifying Your Staff
Once you have created a profile for each worker, Workstaff allows you to efficiently organize and classify your staff with a variety of information detailed below.


## Departments 
If you are part of a complex organization and need to create distinct calendars and different teams, you can create departments in order to split your Workstaff activity into independent data silos that mimic your organizational structure.  


Departments cannot yet be modified on a self-serve basis. Contact us if you'd like changes to be made to your organizational structure.

## Tags 
You can create tags and associate them to your staffâ€™s profiles. Tags allow you to classify your staff and to efficiently search through your database.  

In order to create tags:
1. In the main menu, go to the **Settings** section
2. Go to the **Tabs** section 
3. In the text tab at the bottom of the list, type your tag's name and click on **Add**

Once the tags are created, you can associate them to your staff profiles. 

## Skills 
Creating skills is critical for adding shifts, searching and booking staff.   
When creating a shift, the skills you have associated with each profile allow you to select staff from a list of suggestions of candidates whose skills match the position.  

In order to create skills: 
1. In the main menu, go to the **Settings** section 
2. Go to the **Skills** section
3. Click on **Add** next the category that fits your organization 
4. Name the skill and select the colour you wish to associate with it
5. You can select specific skills to appear in your list by clicking on **Select specific skills** 


## Star Rating 
You can rate each staff on a 5-star scale. See [Staff Profiles](profiles.md) for more details.

## Custom Fields 
You can define custom fields in order to provide additional information to your staff's profiles. This facilitates searching staff according to your organization's specific reality. 

In order to create custom fields:
1. In the main menu, go to the **Settings** section, 
2. Go to the **Custom Fields** sections 
3. Click on **Add** at the bottom of the list 
4. Select the type of value that will be provided in the staff profile  

   You can choose from the custom field types listed below to provide the most relevant information possible to your staff profiles:
- **Yes/No**: answer yes or no to the value associated with the custom field
- **Number**: fill-in the field with a number
- **Single selection**: select a single value from your list
- **Multiple selection**: select one or more values from your list
