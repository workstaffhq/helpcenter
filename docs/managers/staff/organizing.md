# Organizing & Classifying Your Staff
Once you have created a profile for each worker, Workstaff allows you to efficiently organize and classify your staff with a variety of information detailed below.


## Departments 
If you are part of a complex organization and need to create distinct calendars and different teams, you can create departments in order to split your Workstaff activity into independent data silos that mimic your organizational structure.  


Departments cannot yet be modified on a self-serve basis. Contact us if you'd like changes to be made to your organizational structure.

## Tags 
You can create tags and associate them to your staffâ€™s profiles. Tags allow you to classify your staff and to efficiently search through your database.  

In order to create tags:
1. In the main menu, go to the **Settings** section
2. Go to the **Tabs** section 
3. In the text tab at the bottom of the list, type your tag's name and click on **Add**

Once the tags are created, you can associate them to your staff profiles. 

## Skills 
**[Creating skills](../customize/skills.md)** is critical for adding shifts, searching and booking staff.   
When creating a shift, the skills you have associated with each profile allow you to select staff from a list of suggestions of candidates whose skills match the position.
Your staff can add skills to their profiles on the mobile app. These skills will appear as suggestions that you can keep when selecting skills in their profile. 

## Star Rating 
You can rate each staff on a 5-star scale. See [Staff Profiles](profiles.md) for more details.

## Custom Fields 
You can **[create custom fields](../customize/custom-fields.md)** in order to provide additional information to your staff profiles. This facilitates searching staff according to your organization's specific reality. 

You can choose from the custom field types listed below to provide the most relevant information possible to your staff profiles:
- **Yes/No**: answer yes or no to the value associated with the custom field
- **Number**: fill-in the field with a number
- **Single selection**: select a single value from your list
- **Multiple selection**: select one or more values from your list
