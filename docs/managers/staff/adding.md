# Adding Staff From Your Team

One of the first thing you'll need to do when starting with Workstaff is creating a profile for each worker you're going to manage within the platform.

If you manage a large team or are part of a complex organization, you do not need to add everyone to get started with Workstaff. In fact, we usually suggest organizations joining Workstaff to start with subset of their staff (a specific team, department or project) and progressively add more staff as they get more familiar and better understand the tool.

If adopting Workstaff in smaller steps is not an option for your organization, our Customer Success team can help you plan your transition, and we even have the option to import batches of staff from a database you provide.

## Creating Profiles 

1. In the main menu, go to the **Staff** section  
2. Click the **Add** button 
3. Fill in the contact information for each staff you want to add. 
4. Click **Add X staff** to create the profiles in your database.

Only a subset of information about your staff can be provided in this window. Once the profiles are created, [additional information can be provided in the Profile Drawer](profiles).

You can add up to 10 staff at the same time. If you need to add more than 10, you can use the window multiple times, or, for larger staff databases, we also offer a service to import large lists of staff.

When a staff memberâ€™s phone number is from outside of North America, you can add it to their profile but they will not be able to use to log in to the mobile app. Be sure to add a valid email address to their profile so they can use it to log in.

### Optional: Send Invitations

You can optionally send automatic invitation emails to the staff you invite. The email sent by Workstaff will contain instructions to install the mobile app, and will include some branding from your organization (such as the logo). 

To send invitations, select **Send instructions to install the mobile app** before you create the profiles. When this option is selected, at least an email address must be provided for each staff.
