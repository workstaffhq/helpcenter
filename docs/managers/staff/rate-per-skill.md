For each staff member, Workstaff allows you to specify hourly rates for each skill in their profile.
The rate you define for the each skill will be applied to the remuneration conditions whenever you book someone for a specific role.

- Under **Remuneration**, click on **Plan a change and/or specify per-skill rates**
- Select the date from which the rate change will be effective
- Select a skill, enter the corresponding hourly rate and click on **+**
- Click on **Save**.

The new per-skill rates will be applied to all shifts as of the selected date of change.

:::note  
If you do not wish add hourly rates for all of a person's skills, the base hourly rate will be used for the shifts that match the skills for which no rate has been specified.
