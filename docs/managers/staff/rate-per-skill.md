# Planning Hourly Rate Changes and Specifying Per-Skill Rates

Workstaff allows you to add hourly rates per skill to each worker's profile and plan pay changes that will take effect on specific dates.

## Planning a Rate Change
- Go to the **Employment** tab of the worker's profile
- Under Remuneration, click on **Plan a change and/or specify per-skill rates**
- Select the date that the rate change will be effective
- Enter the **New Base Hourly Rate**
- Click on **Save**.

:::note  
You can choose to have the rate change apply to a past date. In this case, the remuneration for all shifts worked on or after that date will be changed.

## Specifying Per-Skill Rates
For each staff member, Workstaff allows you to specify hourly rates for each skill in their profile.
When you book someone for a specific role, their rate for the corresponding skill will be applied to the remuneration conditions. 

- Go to the **Employment** tab of the worker's profile
- Under Remuneration, click on **Plan a change and/or specify per-skill rates**
- Select the date from which the rate change will be effective
- Select a skill
- Enter the corresponding hourly rate and click on **+**
- Click on **Save**.

The new per-skill rates will be applied to all shifts as of the selected change date.

:::note  
If you do not want to change the hourly rate for all of a person's skills, the base hourly rate will be used for the shifts that match the skills for which no rate has been specified.
