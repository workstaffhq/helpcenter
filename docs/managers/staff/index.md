# Manage Your Staff

A key step to adopting Workstaff in your organization is to correctly [onboard your staff](./adding.md). 

The onboarding process is simple and straightforward:
- You first [create a profile](./adding.md#creating-profiles) for each of your staff.
- Then you ask them to install the Workstaff mobile app and login using either the phone number or email address you assigned to their profile.

Once your database starts getting larger, you'll want to make sure it is [organized and classified](./organizing.md) correctly as to efficiently [filter and 
find](./search.md) them for [sending them work offers](../scheduling/publish.md) and [booking them](../scheduling/book.md).
