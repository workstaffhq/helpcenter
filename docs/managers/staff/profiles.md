# The Staff Profile

In addition to basic contact information, Workstaff allows much more information to be provided. To specify extended profile information, open the staff card drawer by clicking any staff in the main **Staff** section.

The staff profile drawer can also generally be accessed by clicking any staff avatar throughout the Workstaff user interface.

## Contact Information

![Contact Information](./images/profile-contact-info.png)

Workstaff allows changing staff's personal information (such as name, birthdate, location) of [Unclaimed](#claimed-vs-unclaimed-profiles) profiles only. To change this information, click the pen button beside the staff name.

## Star Rating

You can rate each staff on a 5-star scale. This information is mainly used for sorting staff in automatic lists provided by Workstaff in different areas of the user interface. Profiles with higher star ratings will usually be displayed first when it makes sense.

## Tags

Tags are simple text labels that can be associated with each profile. They are used mainly to [classify](./organizing) your staff and facilitate [searching](./search) within your database.

## Custom fields (Pro only)

Every [custom field](../customize/custom-fields) you defined in your account settings will be listed on the staff profile so that actual values can be provided.

This information cannot be modified by staff.

## Skills

Each staff can provide a set of skills of their own when they join Workstaff via the mobile app. But, as an employer, you still have full control over which skills you wish to consider for each worker. 

The **Skills** panel allows you to select a set of skills you consider valid for each staff. Any skill provided by the staff on their profile will be shown as suggestions, which you are free to keep or not. You can also add any other skill as needed.

It is critical that the right skills be associated with each staff to use Workstaff productively. See [Organizing & Classifying your staff](organizing) for more details.

## Additional details

The **About Me**, **Spoken Languages**, **Work Experience** and **Transportation** sections can be filled-in by the staff directly in the mobile app once they have [claimed](#claimed-vs-unclaimed-profiles) their account.

## Contact information

You can view and change each worker's contact information in the **Contact** tab. 

Once a profile has been claimed by a worker, only they can edit their contact information.

## Employment Details

### State (active/inactive)

### Employee Number

### Date of Hire

### Status

### Hourly Rate

### Departments


- Fill-in the fields required for your organization
- You can choose to deactivate the profile. Inactive staff will not receive offers or show up as candidates
- To delete the profile, click on **Remove from staff** under the **Notes** tab

## Booking History
The **Booking History** tab allows you to view your staff's past bookings.

## Claimed vs Unclaimed profiles

When you initially add a staff profile in Workstaff, this profile is considered as being _Unclaimed_.

To claim a profile, a staff must install the mobile app and log in using either the phone number or email address associated with their profile.

Once claimed, the profile belongs to the worker and some information can only be modified by the staff, such as:

- Name, contact information and birthdate
- Location information

## Profiles without contact information (placeholders)

Under some circumstances, some workers may need to be added without any contact information. Workstaff allows profiles without any email or phone number to be added and managed as any other profiles.

These kinds of profiles can be booked and managed similarly to any other profiles, but because they don't have any contact information, you'll need to keep the following in mind:

- They will not be able to use Workstaff or log in to the mobile app
- They will never be contacted or receive notifications
