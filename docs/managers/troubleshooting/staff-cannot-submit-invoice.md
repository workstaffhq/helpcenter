# My staff Cannot Send Invoices

Your staff may not be able to send an invoice after a shift. 

In most cases we've observed, this is due to the following reasons: 

## Their Hours Haven't Been Approved

The staff is unable to send invoices if their hours haven't been approved by their manager. If a staff member finds 
themselves in this situation, make sure their timesheet has been approved.
Visit [Time Submission & Approval](../timetracking/submissions.md) for more details. 

## No Remuneration Was Set for the Shift They Worked On

The staff is also unable to send an invoice if no remuneration has been set for their shift. In this case, go to the 
**Remuneration** tab on the project page and make sure to verify the remuneration set for this shift. 
Visit [Remuneration](../scheduling/remuneration.md) for more details.
