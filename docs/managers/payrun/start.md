# Getting Started with the Pay Run Module

## Setting Up Your Account for Pay Run

When you want to start using the Pay Run module, there are a few key steps to create the structure that will allow you to use this tool effectively.

1. Go to the **Payroll** section
2. Click on **Start**
3. Choose the payroll frequency
- Weekly** (52 pay periods per year)
- Bi-weekly** (24 pay periods per year)
4. Choose the start date of the first period.

## Exclude self-employed from payroll
By default, staff with employment status **Contractor / Freelancer** and **Employee** are included in Pay Run. You can exclude contractors / freelancers workers if they should not be included in Pay Run (for example, if you are using integrated invoices).

To make this change:
1. Go to the **Settings** section, then to the **Payroll** tab
2. Check **Exclude contractors from payroll**.

## Prerequisites to Use the Pay Run Module
A few conditions apply for a shift to be taken into account by the Pay Run module:
- Shift remuneration conditions must have been established
- The workers' timesheets must have been submitted and approved
- The data related to the shifts included in the pay period must be up-to-date.
