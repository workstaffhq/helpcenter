Once the timesheets for paid shifts have been submitted and approved
the associated data is generated in the Payroll Assistant module and is frozen until you re-generate the data, if necessary.

Workstaff will show you when the data for that pay period was last generated.

It is recommended that you wait until the payroll period is over to generate the data in the payroll module. You can, if you wish, generate the data for the current period before it is finished. In this case, read the warning carefully and click **I understand, process incomplete pay period now**.

Use the search filters to view stubs by status (**All; Open stubs only; Final stubs only**) or related warnings (**Show obsolete stubs; Show stubs with zero earnings**).
