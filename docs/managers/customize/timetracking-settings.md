# Time Tracking Settings

## Setting Up Your Time Tracking Settings
You can customize options related to tracking your team's time.
- **Do not require a timesheet from staff**: by default, timesheets are mandatory for staff. When this option is checked, timesheet submission will still be allowed but it won't be enforced and clock in reminders will be disabled
- **Unrestricted**: each staff can clock in and out by themselves, from their mobile phone, without any restriction.
- **Via QR code only**: clocking in and out requires the staff to scan a QR code associated with the event
- **Via team leads only**: the staff will be instructed to go see the team lead in person to clock in and out of shifts. See [**Book Your Team**](../scheduling/book.md) for more details about team leads.
