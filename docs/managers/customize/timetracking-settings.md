# Time Tracking Settings

## Configuring Your Time Tracking Settings

You can customize options related to tracking your team's time.
- **Do not require a timesheet from staff**: by default, timesheets are mandatory for staff. When this option is checked, timesheet submission will still be allowed but it won't be enforced and clock in reminders will be disabled
- **Unrestricted**: each staff can clock in and out by themselves, from their mobile phone, without any restriction.
- **Via QR code only**: clocking in and out requires the staff to scan a QR code associated with the event
- **Via team leads only**: the staff will be instructed to go see the team lead in person to clock in and out of shifts. See [**Book Your Team**](../scheduling/book.md) for more details about team leads.

### Timesheet Approval by Team Leads

When this option is enabled, team leads are able to review/approve time entries for shifts worked by others. Their own time submissions will also be automatically approved. You can disable this option if you don't trust your team leads with time approval, including their own time.

### Late Clock-In Notification

When this option is enabled, project coordinators will be notified if a staff member has not clocked in **within 5 minutes of their scheduled shift start time**.

:::note
The notification will be sent **by email** and as a **push notification** on the manager mobile app.

### Maximum Clock In Distance

When a distance is specified, Workstaff will prevent staff from clocking in while they are outside the allowed area, unless they scan a valid QR code.

:::warning
If a staff has refused access to their location, they won't be able to clock in. Furthermore, shorter distance restrictions may prevent legitimate clock ins as mobile GPS location is not always accurate.
