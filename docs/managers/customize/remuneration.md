# Compensation Settings 

Workstaff allows you to customize the way your compensation is calculated for your account. To do so, head to the **Account** tab of the **Settings** section, and scroll down to **Compensation**.

Once you input values in the chosen options, they will automatically be applied to shifts when the specified conditions are fulfilled.

## Standard Pay Rates

Standard pay rates will apply to all your staff when no [specific pay rate](../staff/rate-per-skill.md) is set in their profiles. Individual rates set for workers will always take precedence over the standard rates.
