# Time tracking settings

## Setting up your time tracking settings
You can customize options related to tracking your team's time.
- **Do not require a timesheet from staff**
- **Unrestricted**: each staff can clock in and out by themselves, from their mobile phone, without any restriction.
- **Via QR code only**: clocking in and out requires the staff to scan a QR code associated with the event
- **Via team leads only**: the staff will be instructed to go see the team lead in person to clock in and out of shifts.

Once your employees have clocked in and out of a shift, they will be instructed to **[submit a timesheet] LINK TO TIME SUBMISSION that you can then review and approve.
