# Manage Your Client List

The **Clients** section has been designed to make it easy for you to track and manage your clients. With this section, Workstaff allows you to quickly view your list of clients and create client profiles that can be associated with your projects to maximize your calendar organization.
When a client is associated with a project, the client's name will appear on the project page and in the calendar. Additionally, you will be able to view the project history for each of your clients.

## Adding a New Client
In the main menu, go to the **Clients** section
- Click on **Add Client**
- Fill in the company name
- Click on **Create**.

## Importing a Client List

Need to create multiple clients at once? Our bulk import tool makes it fast and easy.

Download an [example file](https://employer.workstaff.app/en/assets/import-templates/client-import.csv) to get started, then fill it out by following the import rules below:

| **Field** | **Mandatory?** | **Notes**        |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| Name      | Yes           | Client’s name    |
| Code      | No            | Client code      |
| Address   | No            | Client’s address |

Once your file is ready, you can import it from the **Clients** tab by clicking the **three dots** next to the **Add Client** button, then selecting **Import**.

The system will automatically detect any errors and display them **before finalizing** the import. You’ll be able to fix them and restart the import process.

Once the import reaches 100%, your clients will be created!

## General

### Basic Information
Once you have added a client to your list, you can display their profile by clicking on their name.
Under **Basic Information**, you can edit their name and add their address.

### Management Team
Workstaff allows you to assign [**specific management teams**](../scheduling/management-teams.md) to each of your clients. You can add as many people as you want to these teams and choose which ones are included in the team discussions related to these projects. When you assign a management team to a client, it will automatically be assigned to all projects you create for that client.

## Projects

### History
The **Project History** allows you to keep track of all the projects you have created for each one of your clients.

### Default Settings

The information configured in this section will be applied to every new project created for this client.

- **Default location**
- **Information documents for staff**
- [**Field Reports**](../addons/field-reports.md)
- **Notes to Staff**
- **Excluded Staff**

:::note
These settings can always be adjusted individually for each project, if needed.
:::

## Archiving/Deleting a Client
You can archive a client by clicking on **Archive** next to their name in the client list.
When you archive a client, they will be removed from your active client list and moved to the "Archived" tab. This way, you can still access information and project history related to this client and choose to **unarchive** them if necessary.

You can also permanently remove a client from your list by clicking on **Delete**.

:::note
You can only delete a client if they are not attached to any project.
