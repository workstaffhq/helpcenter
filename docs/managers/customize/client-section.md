# Manage Your Client List

The **Clients** section has been designed to make it easy for you to track and manage your clients. With this section, Workstaff allows you to quickly view your list of clients and create client profiles that can be associated with your projects to maximize your calendar organization.
When a client is associated with a project, the client's name will appear on the project page and in the calendar. Additionally, you will be able to view the project history for each of your clients.


## Adding a New Client
In the main menu, go to the **Clients** section
- Click on **Add Client**
- Fill in the company name
- Click on **Create**.

## Basic Information
Once you have added a client to your list, you can display their profile by clicking on their name.
Under **Basic Information**, you can edit their name and add their address.

## Management Team
Workstaff allows you to assign [**specific management teams**](../scheduling/management-teams.md) to each of your clients. You can add as many people as you want to these teams and choose which ones are included in the team discussions related to these projects. When you assign a management team to a client, it will automatically be assigned to all projects you create for that client.

## Default Project Location
You have the option to designate a default project location that will be automatically assigned to any new projects created for this client. However, please keep in mind that you can still modify the location for each individual project if necessary.

## Project History
The **Project History** allows you to keep track of all the projects you have created for each one of your clients.

## Archiving/Deleting a Client
You can archive a client by clicking on **Archive** next to their name in the client list.
When you archive a client, they will be removed from your active client list and moved to the "Archived" tab. This way, you can still access information and project history related to this client and choose to **unarchive** them if necessary.

You can also permanently remove a client from your list by clicking on **Delete**.

:::note
You can only delete a client if they are not attached to any project.
