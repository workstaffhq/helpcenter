# Manage Your Client List

The **Client** section has been created in order to make it easier for you to track your clients.
All the clients you previously added when creating new projects are now listed in this section.


## Adding a New Client
In the main menu, go to the **Clients** section
- Click on **Add Client**
- Fill in the company name
- Click on **Create**.

## Basic Information
Once you have added a client to your list, you can display their profile by clicking on their name.
Under **Basic Information**, you can edit their name and add their address.

## Management Team
Workstaff allows you to assign [**specific management teams**](https://help.workstaff.app/docs/managers/scheduling/management-teams/) to each of your clients. You can add as many people as you want to these teams and choose which ones are included in the team discussions related to these projects. When you assign a management team to a client, it will automatically be assigned to all projects you create for that client.

## Default Project Location
You can set a default project location that will be automatically assigned to all new projects created for this client. Note that you can still edit the location for each individual project.

## Connect Status
In the **Clients** section, Workstaff allows you to know if each client:
- Is active on **Workstaff Connect**
- Has been invited to use **Workstaff Connect**
- Has not been invited.

You can invite a client to use **Workstaff Connect** in just a few steps:
- Click on your clientâ€™s name in the list
- Head to the **Connect** tab on their profile
- Click on **Enable access for this client**
- Share the displayed link with your client.
