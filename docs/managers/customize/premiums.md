## Automated Premiums 

Workstaff allows you to add automated premiums to your projects’ remuneration conditions.

When creating a new premium, you can set the rules and have the premium applied to corresponding shifts automatically:

- **To any hour worked between “start time” and “end time”**: The premium will applied to all the hours worked between the start and end time you selected;
- **When shift is for any of these skills**: Every time a worker is booked for one of the selected roles, the premium is applied to their booking’s remuneration conditions;
- **When shift is on these days of the week**: The premium is applied to the shifts taking place on the selected days;
- **When staff profile has field “…” with value “…”**: The premium is automatically applied to all booked staff having the selected custom field and value in their profile;
- **When staff employment status “…”**: The premium is automatically applied to all booked staff having the selected employment status in their profile.
- **When staff is flagged as a team lead on the shift**: The premium is automatically applied to all designated team leads on the project.
