# Organization Settings

Workstaff offers you different customization options that will allow you to mimic your organization’s structure and activity.
The different customization options available to you are listed below.

## Account
Setting up the following general settings for your organization in Workstaff is a crucial step.

### Your Organization
In this section, fill-in the general information about your organization such as:
- A logo
- The name of your company
- Your organization type (For profit/ Other or Non profit)

### Time & Location
Select your organization’s **Timezone** and your **Headquarters** location for distance and time offset calculations. Selecting the day will determine how your Calendar and Timesheets will be displayed and organized on Workstaff.

### Defaults
1. Select who amongst your account users will be the **Default contact person**.
2. Select your **Default compensation mode** (None; Hourly, Volunteer). The mode you select will be applied to all new events.
3. The **Default employment status** (Contractor/Freelancer, Payroll, Volunteer) you select will be added to all new staff profiles. You can still select a status for each staff member by editing it directly in their profile.

### Notifications
**Enable upcoming shift reminders** to help reduce no-shows. The staff will receive reminders of upcoming shifts around 24h before their first shift on a project. 
When this option is enabled, staff can also be **asked to reconfirm their shifts when reminders are sent**, ensuring their commitment.

### Time Tracking
You can customize [**options related to tracking your team's time**](timetracking-settings.md).
- **Do not require a timesheet from staff**: by default, timesheets are mandatory for staff. When this option is checked, timesheet submission will still be allowed but it won't be enforced and clock in reminders will be disabled.
- **Unrestricted**: each staff can clock in and out by themselves, from their mobile phone, without any restriction.
- **Via QR code only**: clocking in and out requires the staff to scan a QR code associated with the event.
- **Via team leads only**: the staff will be instructed to go see the team lead in person to clock in and out of shifts.

### Invoicing
If you work with contractors/freelancers, fill-in the invoicing information so they can submit invoices. This information is used on generated invoices.

:::note
A **Billing Address must** be provided in your account before any contractor can submit an invoice via Workstaff. 
:::

By default, Workstaff will request invoices for compensated shifts of contractors. When the **Do not require invoices from contractors** is checked, invoices submission will still be allowed but it won't be enforced.

## Users
The **Users** section allows you to manage who can access your Workstaff account. You can overview your active and inactive users, add or delete users from your account, and manage their roles and permissions based on your organization's needs.

### User Roles
- **Account Owner**: The primary user with full control over the account. They are responsible for managing billing, account settings, and user permissions. The Account Owner can transfer ownership, add or remove users, and make key decisions about account configuration and usage.
- **Administrator**: Has the same level of access as the Account Owner, including full permissions to manage users, settings, and account configurations. The key difference lies in their responsibilities: Administrators can manage the account but do not hold ownership and are not responsible for overarching decisions such as billing or ownership transfers.
- **Member**: Has access to all areas of the account except settings and anything related to compensation, including payroll and billing, unless explicitly granted permission.

:::note
**Account Owners** can transfer ownership of the account to another manager user through the action menu next to their name. From the same table, compensation access can be granted to Members by an Administrator or the Account Owner.

See [**Manage Your Subscription**](../billing/manage-users.md) for more details on how to manage users. 

## Departments
You can split your Workstaff activity into multiple independent data silos to mimic your organization structure. Creating departments allows you to divide your staff and schedules in order to facilitate your operations.
