# Clock In / Clock Out

Workstaff allows your employees to clock in and out of a shift through different options you can choose from.
As an employer, this feature allows you to track your staffâ€™s time in real time. 


## Clock in / Clock out options  
You can customize options related to tracking your team's time.
- **Do not require a timesheet from staff**
- **Unrestricted**: each staff can clock in and out by themselves, from their mobile phone, without any restriction.
- **Via QR code only**: clocking in and out requires the staff to scan a QR code associated with the event 
- **Via team leads only**: the staff will be instructed to go see the team lead in person to clock in and out of shifts.  

Once your employees have clocked in and out of a shift, they will be instructed to **[submit a timesheet](submissions.md)** that you can then review and approve. 

## Live time tracking 
Keep track of your staff's time by going to the **Today** section in the main menu, and clicking on the event under the **Dashboard**. Staff presence will automatically update as staff clock in and out using the mobile app.
