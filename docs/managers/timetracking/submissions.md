# Time Submission & Approval

Once your staff have clocked in and out of a shift, they'll be instructed to submit their timesheets from their mobile phone. Workstaff facilitates keeping track of your staffâ€™s time submissions.

## Timesheets 
You can easily overview the timesheets submitted by your staff by going to the **Timesheets** section in the main menu.
This section allows you to filter the timesheets in the ways listed below:
- **All**: Display all upcoming, pending and approved timesheets.
- **Awaiting Submission**: display only the timesheets that your staff has not yet submitted
- **To Approve**: display all timesheets submitted by your staff

The **Timesheets** feature allows you to have an overview of the scheduled time and the reported time.
You have the possibility to edit a timesheet if the information it contains is incorrect or if the staff forgot to clock in or clock out. 

You can export excel reports from the timesheets by clicking on **Download**.
