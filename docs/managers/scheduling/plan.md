## Draft mode 

Before you complete a project and notify your staff of their new bookings, Workstaff allows you to work in draft mode. When you create an event and add shifts to which you assign staff, the project is in draft mode by default. This allows you to make any changes you want and apply them to the project once you are satisfied by clicking on **Review and Apply** on the project page. Your staff will then receive a notification regarding their bookings.
