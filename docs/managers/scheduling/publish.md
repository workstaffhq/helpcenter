# Publish Shifts
Workstaff allows you to publish shifts, which essentially means that you can post offers that your staff can review and apply to from their mobile phones. New offer notifications are sent to staff once a day at 3PM local time. When staff have applied to the shift you have published, you can choose who to book from a list of candidates.

## Publishing a shift 
1. On the project page, go to **Publishing**.
2. Select the position you wish to publish
3. Under **Publishing Options**, you can select whether you want to publish the shift:
- **to staff with matching skills**: you can use the filters to further narrow your search
- **to specific people**: you can select the staff you wish to send the offer to
4. Go under **Notes to staff** to add any additional information that the candidates can read upon opening the offer
5. Click on **Publish**
