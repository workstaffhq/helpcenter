# Uploading documents to your projects


When you create a project, Workstaff allows you to upload pdf documents to share with your staff.

There are several places you can go to upload documents:
On your project page, go to the **Notes & Documents** tab and click **Upload** to choose which documents to attach to the project
Or click on the cog icon in the upper right hand corner of the page and click on **Settings**. Then go to the **Documents** tab and click on **Upload**.

Once the documents have been uploaded, the staff you have booked for that project will be able to view them on the mobile app by opening the shift details, with the documents located under **Important Readings**.
