## Reverting the Last Changes 
Workstaff offers you the flexibility to revert the last changes within your projects. This feature serves as a safety net, allowing you to backtrack and correct any modifications or mistakes.

Workstaff offers you the flexibility to revert the last changes within your projects. This feature serves as a safety net, allowing you to backtrack and correct any modifications or mistakes.

1. **Revert Last Changes**: This function enables you to retract the most recent action performed in your project. Whether it’s adding, deleting, or modifying shifts and bookings, it swiftly restores the project to its previous state. You can use it to backtrack through a series of actions, progressively reverting all changes made since the last saved version of the project.
2. **Discard All Draft Changes**: This function allows you to discard all unsaved modifications and revert the project to its last saved state. If you've made multiple adjustments but wish to return to the original saved version without individually undoing each change, this feature efficiently clears all draft modifications, ensuring a clean slate for further editing or review.
