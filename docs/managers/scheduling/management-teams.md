# Assign Management Teams to Your Projects

Workstaff allows you to assign specific management teams to each of your projects. You can add as many people as you want to these teams and choose which ones are included in the team discussions related to these projects. Each member of the management team can then see exactly which projects are assigned to them in the **Calendar**, by choosing to display their **schedules only**.

## Assigning a Management Team to a Project
Workstaff allows you to assign a management team to each project, whether it is linked to a client or not.

:::note  
If a client has a management team assigned, any new project created for that client will automatically inherit that team by default.
You can still change the assigned management team for each project individually if needed.

To learn how to assign a management team to a client, see [**Assigning a Management Team to a Client**](../clients/manage-client-list.md#management-team)
:::

### To assign a management team to a project:
1. Go to your project page
2. Click on **Settings**.
3. Under **Management Team**, click on the empty box and select the next person you wish to add to the team, then click **+**
4. Select the person's role (Lead, Coordinator, or none)
5. If they are not a **Coordinator**, set whether they are a **Contact person for staff**
6. Once the management team is composed, click **Save**
