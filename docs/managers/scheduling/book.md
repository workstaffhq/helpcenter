## Booking Staff Using The **Candidates** Organizer

The **Candidates** organizer is a tool that allows you to book staff in different ways.
In this tab, you can see at a glance the **Candidates** that have applied for positions you’ve published and staff **Suggestions**.

### Booking Candidates That Have Applied For Positions

### Selecting Staff Without Booking Them Yet
If you wish to make a list of the staff that will work on your project without booking them on any specific shift yet, you can also click on **+** in the **Candidates** organizer to add them top your list of candidates you can later book.

### Expand and Collapse Bookings
When you book a large amount of people on a project, Workstaff automatically collapses the shifts' details. 
You can freely expand and collapse the details of all your shifts by clicking on the **Expand/Collapse** icon on the top right of the project page. 
You can also expand and collapse the details of each shift by placing your cursor on it and clicking on the **Expand/Collapse** icon.
