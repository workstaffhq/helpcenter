# Projects and Shifts Import Tool

Need to set up several projects at once, each with their own schedules and shifts? Our new bulk import tool makes it fast and easy.
Whether you’re onboarding a new client, preparing for a busy season, or simply want to save time, you can now import everything in just a few clicks — directly from an Excel or CSV file.

This powerful feature lets you:
- Create multiple projects in one import.
- Add schedules and shifts to each project.
- Avoid repetitive manual entry.

Download a [sample file](https://employer.workstaff.app/en/assets/import-templates/shift-import.csv) to get started.

## Pre-requisites
- If the projects you’re importing need to be linked to a client, make sure to [**add the client**](../customize/client-section.md#adding-a-new-client) in Workstaff first.
- Ensure that any skills used in the imported projects already exist in your Workstaff account.

:::info
To add shifts to an existing project, please specify the project code and/or project title.
If you’d like the new shifts to be added to an existing schedule, make sure to also include the schedule label.

## Uploading your file

When filling out the import file, make sure to include key information such as the project name and location on each row of the file. If this information is missing or inconsistent, the system will assume they are separate projects and create multiple ones instead of grouping them under the same project.

Once your file is ready, you can upload it from the Calendar tab by clicking the three dots next to the “New shift” button, then selecting “Import”.
If you don’t see this option in your account, please [contact us](mailto:support@workstaff.app) and we’ll activate it for you.

During the upload process, the system will automatically detect and display any errors before the import is finalized. This allows you to make corrections and ensure a clean import.

:::warning
We recommend testing your file with one or two projects first before proceeding with a larger import.

You’ll be able to track the progress of the import directly in the interface. Once it reaches 100%, your projects and shifts will be fully created — and you’ll be all set to start booking staff!
