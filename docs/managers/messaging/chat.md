# Chat / Instant Messaging

Workstaff has integrated instant messaging to communicate with your staff and teams more efficiently. 

:::info
You can only chat with team members who have installed the Workstaff mobile app.

## Types Of Conversations

### 1:1 (One to One)

You can use the chat to start conversation with any staff member.

1. Click on the messaging icon in the top right corner of the main Workstaff interface.
2. Click on **Start a new conversation** to select which staff member you wish to communicate with

One-to-One conversations can also be started or resumed from the top of any staff profile drawer and from other places. Look for the messaging bubble icon to start or resume direct conversations with staff.

### Team Chats

You can also use the chat to communicate with entire teams. Workstaff always ensures the participants in each team 
chat continuously match the team booked for the project/schedule the conversation was initially created for.
As team members are booked or unbooked from the team, they'll also be added or removed from the team conversation (if any) 
associated with the project/schedule.

1. To start a new team conversation,  go to the **Team** tab on your project page
2. Click on **Chat with team**
3. Once youâ€™ve started the conversation, you can always go back to it by clicking on the messaging icon in the top right corner of the page

## Sending Links in Chat Messages

Clickable links to Web pages can also be sent in chat messages just by copy/pasting the link to the page you want to send. Links must start with either `http://...` or `https://` to be recognized by Workstaff as clickable links.

## Sending Rich Text in Chat Messages

It is possible to send chat messages with simple formatting, for example, make your content stand out or emphasize parts of it. 

To do so, parts of your message can include additional syntax as described here:

| Formatting | What to do?                                             | Example chat message        | Result                    |
|------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Bold**   | Surround text to be put in bold with double asterisks   | `My name is **John Smith**` | My name is **John Smith** |
| *Italic*   | Surround text to be put in italic with single asterisks | `My name is *John Smith*`   | My name is *John Smith*   |
