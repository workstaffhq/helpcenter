# Broadcasts: send mass messages

Broadcasting allow to quickly and efficiently send mass messages to all your staff. They are often used in lieu of 
emails to inform teams about important information, request them to fill in their availabilities for hot periods of 
activity, or any other one-way communication needs.

Broadcasts are sent individually to each team member, and each team member who receives a broadcast message can mark 
it as read and/or reply to it if any follow up is required. 
Replies to broadcasts will actually be sent in new [1:1 conversations](./chat.md) with the original sender of the broadcast. 

1. To send a broadcast to your staff, click on the message icon
2. Click on the **Broadcast** tab
3. Click on +
4. Select recipients in the `To:` field. You can also add many (or all) staff using the magnifying glass / search icon.
5. Provide a subject and compose the broadcast body, then click *Send*

When you send a broadcast, your staff will receive a push notification to their phone and an email. 
The push notification does not include the actual broadcast's content, but the email notification does. 

Once sent, a broadcast will stay visibile in each of your team's inbox for as long as it exists.
