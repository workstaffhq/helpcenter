# Communicating With Your Staff

Workstaff has robust integrated communications features that allow you to stay connected with your team directly from within the platform and/or the mobile app.

There are two main ways to stay in touch with your staff:

1. [**Chat / Instant Messaging**](./chat.md): Bidirectional and instant text communications with your staff.
2. [**Broadcasts**](./broadcasts.md): Unidirectional mass messages to either your entire team, or select staff.
