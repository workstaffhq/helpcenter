## Getting Started in 3 Easy Steps

### 1. Creating A Document Type

In the **Settings** menu, click **Documents**, then create a new document type by clicking **+ Add type**. Enter a name and click **Save**.

Once created, the document type will be available for selecting when uploading documents to staff profiles.

### 2. Requesting Documents To Staff

On a staff profile, navigate to the **Documents** tab. You can **Request** a document or directly **Upload** it.

When a document is requested, staff will be prompted to upload the document. It will appear in their To-Do list under the Today tab. 
Once the document is submitted by the staff, it will appear on the staff profile as **Pending Approval**, and you'll be able to:
- **Approve** the document.
- **Reject** the document.
- **Upload a new version** of this document.
- Add an **expiration date** and choose whether to notify staff as the expiry date approaches.

:::info
Staff will receive notifications when a document is requested and when it’s nearing expiration (up to 30 days before expiration), prompting them to upload an updated version.
