## Getting Started in 3 Easy Steps

### 1. Adding The Field Reports Add-On

In the **Settings** section, navigate to the **Add-ons** menu and click **Activate** under **Field Reports**.

### 2. Creating A Questionnaire

On the **Parameters** menu, click **Questionnaires**, then create a new questionnaire by clicking **+ New Questionnaire**. Add a title and click **+ Add Question**. You'll then need to fill in the following details before adding the question:
- **Name**: A short, informative name for internal use.
- **Type**: Choose from Open Text, Number, Multiple Choice, Single Choice, or Rating Scale.
- **Optional**: Specify whether the question is optional.
- **Question**: The actual question that will be shared with staff.
- **Help Text**: Additional guidance to help staff understand the question.
- **Additional information** Required for Multiple Choice, Single Choice, and Rating Scale fields.

Once completed, the questionnaire will be available for selection in any project.

:::note
A questionnaire can also be assigned to a client by default. This means that for every project created for this client, the questionnaire will automatically be linked, and your staff will always be required to submit Field Reports. Take a look at our [Feature Matrix](../features-matrix.md) to see if this feature is included in your plan.
