# Staff Selection via the Client Portal

Workstaff now allows your clients to participate directly in the team selection process through the Client Portal. Whether it's to **confirm a proposed team** or to **choose from a list of suggested candidates**, this feature makes collaboration between you and your clients smoother and more transparent.

Contact our [Customer Success](mailto:customer.success@workstaff.app) team to activate the [Client Portal](./client-portal.md) add-on for your Workstaff account.

## Creating and Sharing a Staff Selection

To create a staff selection for a project:

- Go to the project in Workstaff and navigate to the **Staff Selections** tab.  
- There, you'll be able to view any existing selections for the project or **create a new selection**. Fill in:
  - **Selection name**
  - **Required skill**
  - **Minimum number of staff to select**
- Click **Next**, then select the staff you'd like to include in the staff selection for your client to choose from.
- Click **Send to Client**, or save it as a draft to finalize later.

Once the selection is shared, its status will appear as **Awaiting Client**.

:::info
The owner of the client portal will automatically receive an **email notification** informing them that a **staff selection is pending**.
:::

## Client View and Team Selection

On their side, the client will see a task under **Select your team** in the portal.

They will be able to:
- View the proposed candidates for the specified skill.
- Select the staff they prefer (they may choose **more than the minimum required** if they wish).
- Submit their selection.

As soon as the client submits their selection, the status will automatically update to **Completed**, and you’ll receive an **email notification**.

## Applying the Selection

After your client submits their selection, click **Apply to candidates** to automatically move the selected staff into the **Candidates** section of the **Scheduling** tab.

From there, you can proceed with your usual [booking process](../scheduling/book.md#booking-staff-using-the-candidates-organizer) — now with input directly from your client, all in one place.
