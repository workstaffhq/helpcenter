# Getting Started

When you start using Workstaff as an employer, there are some key steps to create the structure that will allow you to use the platform effectively. 

## Configuring settings and customizations
Configuring and customizing your settings is one of the first things you will need to do as it allows you to define the basics of your organization and to create skills and custom fields that will allow you to manage your staff and calendar with ease. 

## Creating staff profiles 
[Creating your staff profiles](../managers/staff/adding.md) is a critical step as it allows you to assign staff to different shifts and gives your staff the opportunity to log in to the mobile app and apply to shifts youâ€™ve published offers for,  view their schedule,  and clock in and out of shifts. 

## Creating events 
[Creating projects](../managers/scheduling/plan.md) establishes a base that you can then complete with shifts and build up your schedule.

## Adding shifts 
[Creating shifts](../managers/scheduling/plan.md) allows you to detail your needs in terms of positions and workers for each event. 

## Publishing shifts 
Workstaff allows you to [publish offers](../managers/scheduling/publish.md) for shifts that you wish to fill. Your staff will then be able to apply for these shifts and you will be able to choose from a list of candidates to fill the positions. 

## Booking staff 
Once you have created shifts, you can [book staff](../managers/scheduling/book.md) in the following ways:
1. From the list of candidates who have applied for these shifts
2. From the list of staff suggestions provided by Workstaff
3. From your entire staff list
   Once your staff is assigned to a shift, they will be notified on the mobile app.
