# Managing Your Seats / Users

Workstaff allows you to add or remove seats according to your needs. Seats are administrative/office users and anyone who needs access to Workstaff's management features. You can add or remove seats yourself at any time directly in Workstaff. Your monthly charges will be automatically adjusted and current month charges will be charged on a prorated basis.

## Adding a Seat
- Go to the main section **Settings**, then go to the **Users** tab
- Enter the first name, last name and email of the new user
- Click on **Invite**.

## Removing a Seat
- Go to the main **Settings** section, then go to the **Users** tab
- Click on **Delete** next to the user's name.

## Deactivating a Seat
Users can be temporarily deactivated when, for example, your business is seasonal. Inactive users cannot log in and do not count towards your seat limit.

To deactivate a seat, click **Deactivate** next to the user's name.

## Replacing a seat
Workstaff allows you to replace a user without having to add another seat to your subscription.

To replace a seat:
- First deactivate the seat to be replaced
- Then enter the new seatâ€™s information
- Click on **Invite** to have this seat replace the one you just deactivated.
