# Getting Started With Invoicing

## Configuring your account for invoicing

Making sure your Workstaff account is ready for invoicing is simple. The only requirement is that a **Billing address** must be provided in your [account settings](../customize/account.md#Invoicing).

## Conditions for a shift to be invoiceable

In addition to making sure a **Billing address** is provided on your account, the following conditions must be met for any given shift to be invoiceable by one of your staff:

1. The staff who worked on a shift must have an employment status of **Contractor**.
2. The shift in question must be remunerated (see the project's **Remuneration** tab to confirm remuneration of shifts)
3. A time entry must have been submitted **and approved** for that shift.
