# Invoicing Workflow

## Submission

When staff submits an invoice, you can view it in the **Invoices** section of the main menu.

You can filter your invoice list in the following ways:
- All
- To Approve
- Approved
- Paid 

## Reconciliation

When the time billed matches the time entries and the hourly rate submitted matches the posted rate, Workstaff makes it easy for you to verify by displaying it on the invoice.

If the information does not match, Workstaff will show you directly on the invoice what the incorrect data is so that you can verify the information and, if necessary, chat with your staff so that they can submit a new corrected invoice.

## Approval

If the information on the invoice is correct, simply click on **Approve**. Your staff will be notified of the invoice approval on the mobile app and the rest of the process.

## Downloading an invoice

You can export the invoice to a pdf format by going to **Actions** and clicking on **Download**.
